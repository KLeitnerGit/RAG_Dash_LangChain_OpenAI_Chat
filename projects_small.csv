As part of this study, we analyzed how the traditional mortgage process looks today and where and to what extent there is potential for cost savings. The analysis of this study is limited to the mortgage process, since this takes a comparatively long time and is repeated frequently. In cooperation with the digitization and security product provider ti&m, the mortgage processes of five medium-sized Swiss retail banks were examined using detailed interviews. The analysis of the credit processes is limited to mortgages for private individuals and the standard case that the customer seeks personal contact for the new contract.

Buildings made of brick survive for centuries, the decay products do not generate any pollutants and are partially populated with plants. The use of ceramic materials for plant containers is known. In the research project, new combinations of the two functionalities of building material and support for planting are being developed. In a basic research ""GreenBrick-Basic"", the basic combinations ""type of plant - type of carrier material"" were broadly explored and vegetation strategies were tested on different ceramic material properties and structures. Based on this, the geometry of the carrier module, construction variants and the regulated irrigation by storing and releasing rainwater are investigated in depth in the present project. Ultimately, a future-oriented product for a greenable wall and facade system is to be developed, which is being explored for different possible applications and architectural typologies. The climatic effectiveness inside and outside is evaluated and optimized. In the context of dense construction and climate change, this vertical greening increases the quality of life in the long term: it uses natural resources, cools the environment through evaporation and promotes biodiversity. Interdisciplinary project development is a basic prerequisite for successfully merging the complex relationships between the biosystem, climate regulation, material and architecture into a holistic system."," Gassler Cornelia,  Arnold Kilian,  Koschenz Markus,  Huwiler Martin,  Häusermann Martina,  King Marvin,  Hartmann Nicole,  Amstutz Sibylla,  Triller Susanne"," Müggler Zumstein Isabel Rosa,  Amstutz Sibylla"

Sustainability is an abstract concept that is not easy to convey. However, it is essential that information is easy to understand so that it can have an effect on consumers. Cues and ratings represent information that is easy to understand. Potential guests are used to ratings from booking (e.g. booking.com) and rating platforms (e.g. TripAdvisor). Consumers are booking more and more via online platforms, today almost 30% of all hotel bookings in Switzerland are made via online booking platforms (Schegg, 2018). The existing ratings on the online platforms summarize the satisfaction of guests and make it visible at a glance - and consumers rely on the ratings when choosing a hotel. Sustainability ratings, which take into account the ecological and/or social sustainability dimension, could therefore inform consumers about the sustainability of a hotel in a simple manner."," Stämpfli Aline,  Handschuh Michael,  Ponnapureddy Sindhuri", Priskin Julianna

Based on evidence from research, it can be assumed that siblings of people with a disability or a chronic illness are in a life situation with a lower quality of life and an increased risk of developmental disabilities. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) is investigating the life situation of siblings in Switzerland on behalf of the association Raum für Geschwister VRG and the Stiftung KiFa Schweiz. The aim is to make the social relevance visible. The results of the study are intended to help ensure that siblings of children and adults with disabilities can grow up and live in a development-promoting life situation and receive the necessary support. A so-called “mixed method design” was chosen for the planned study. This means that there is both a quantitative and a qualitative approach in order to be able to answer the question in a well-founded manner. A methodological approach is proposed that takes into account the active inclusion of the persons to be examined (participatory research approach). First, existing basics from research, statistical surveys and support models for siblings are systematically researched and summarized. An overview of the current state of research and an approximation of the number of siblings of children with disabilities in Switzerland will be prepared. Subsequently, the life situation of the siblings in childhood and adulthood of people with disabilities is examined with a quantitative survey using a short questionnaire. A more in-depth investigation of the situation then follows via a qualitative research approach. The aim of this part of the study is to describe the life situation of children, adolescents and adults who have a sibling with a disability. It is about development-promoting and development-impairing factors of life situations. A special focus is placed on identifying the support needs of siblings who are at particularly high risk of developing disabilities."," Schraner Marco,  Mikolasek Michael,  Zambrino Natalie", Adler Judith

If several sound sources are present at the same time, traditional measurement methods fail. In this project, an alternative approach from AI is to be tested. Capturing the onset of sound is one of the most elementary achievements of the human perceptual apparatus. When making music, this ability forms an indispensable basis: synchronization with a sequence of sound events would be unthinkable without precise perception of sound attacks. In the scientific study of music, too, the measurement of the times at which music is used plays a fundamental role in a wide variety of questions. As part of the digitization of music research, tools are increasingly being used for this purpose, which are summarized in computer science under the term “music information retrieval”. Experience with these tools has shown, however, that complex sound signals, such as those that arise when several instruments interact due to the superimposition of the sound events, quickly push the automated ""onset detection"" of existing software solutions to their limits. With this project, based on the latest developments in the field of artificial intelligence, a new approach is to be implemented and evaluated in comparison to existing tools. The successful implementation of a new approach opens up not only use for research purposes but also a promising perspective for further development projects in the field of music production.",," Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Pfäffli Daniel"

The US has stricter regulations and the market demands taller flagpoles with larger flags. Higher masts tend to vibrate, which leads to a dynamic increase in stress, which is irrelevant given the dimensions that are usual today. The highest stresses on flagpoles are limited to a few neuralgic zones, such as the base of the pole, the transition to other cross-sections, cutouts or jumps in cross-section.

Data triangulation was also used based on evidence from innovation-related internal documents, transcribed statements and discussions, and third party articles. The empirical results showed that there are certain key players and different forms of interactions that support or hinder the implementation of technological innovation. The supporting key players identified here are: knowledge sharing exploitative players, innovation supporting informal leaders, and the so-called side changers, that is, key players who were once located on the exploitative or explorative side and later changed sides when taking over new functions. Key players with a strongly inhibitory impact are: innovation opposing informal leaders, non-cooperative exploitative players, and fanatic explorative players. With regard to formal and informal interactions, it was verified that informal interactions have a tremendous influence, both at the top and bottom of the hierarchy, on the successful implementation of an innovation. The main conclusions and implications drawn from the research are that the election of the program leader for the implementation of an innovation as well as the election and involvement of other key players are crucial. Formal and, especially, informal channels should also be managed as closely as possible in such undertaking. Interaction processes between exploitative and explorative players should be iteratively intensified and managed closely, and trust should be considered a source of traction when implementing an innovation. Therefore, the successful implementation of an innovation depends on several parameters within the broader organizational context, but most notably on strong leadership, deliberate listening to and engagement with the exploitative players, the management of informal channels, and transparency in communication.",, Kraner Jan

One of the desiderata of German-language Bach research is a treatise that traces the basics of the musical language of Bach and his contemporaries from a historical perspective and conveys all of its aspects in a meaningful structure. Bruno Zanolini's ambitious monograph is such an overall presentation, but due to the language barrier it has hardly been received outside of Italy since it was published in 1993. The aim of the German translation is to make the insights gathered by the author with immense expertise accessible to a broad readership in teaching and research. It is hoped that impulses will be given to scientific discourse, which will encourage people to follow up on the results of Zanolini's book, to discuss them critically and to continue working on the basis of this foundation."," Baldassarre Antonio,  Szamatulski Katrin,  Mutter Peter", Zink Michael

Using intelligent algorithms, systems should be automatically monitored with regard to energy consumption. This leads to more efficient operation and CO2 reduction. The building technology systems of a large building park are monitored via the energy management platform of MST Systemtechnik AG. At present, this is done using, among other things, manually set limit values (e.g. the maximum power consumption of a ventilation system). This is complex, requires a lot of knowledge and is therefore not widely used today. It should therefore be possible to automatically monitor systems in the future using intelligent algorithms. This leads to more efficient operation and thus to CO2 savings, because thanks to the automatic in contrast to the current manual monitoring, limit values can be set for more systems and the limit values can be set more narrowly. A tighter limit value leads to faster detection of increased energy consumption, for example if the ventilation filter is clogged."," Camenzind Martin,  Schranz Raphael", Huber Mittler Patrick

A project within the framework of the ÖGM (www.hslu.ch/oegm). Demographic developments, the increase in chronic and complex illnesses and other trends pose major challenges for the Swiss healthcare system. The combination of medical, nursing and social needs will have significant consequences for healthcare. The increase in costs and the resulting increasing burden on all funding bodies also increase the demands on the control of health care in the direction of quality and economy. At the same time, the treatment and care options have become so differentiated in the recent past that the care pathways are becoming increasingly fragmented. Fragmented treatment paths expose patients to considerable risks and often entail additional costs. In order to counteract the challenges for the health system and the risks of fragmentation, greater integration in health care is necessary. The concept of integrated care includes a variety of organizational models, concepts and instruments for better networking and cooperation within and between service providers. The objective of the mandate is to identify, describe and analyze the current and future roles of the public sector in integrated care. The methodological approach is based on an analysis of the literature and on a qualitative and quantitative survey of federal, cantonal and communal actors as well as other actors. The study consists of four modules. (1) First, within the framework of a theoretical part, we create a systematic understanding of the roles the state plays and can play in the healthcare system (and in particular with regard to integrated care). (2) We then use a literature analysis to compare the role of the public sector in integrated care in different countries. (3) On this basis, we develop and carry out the instruments for the third part, the empirical study. (4) Building on this, in the fourth module we formulate conclusions from the research results and recommendations for action for the Confederation, cantons and municipalities.

They have changed communication behavior in the long term: grandparents use it to communicate with their grandchildren, lecturers use it to exchange information with students, and customers use it to maintain an exchange with companies. The initial separation between more professional networks such as LinkedIn or Xing and private networks such as Facebook can no longer be maintained. The mixing of private and public communication has long since become a fact. This is already evident from the fact that opening a company page on Facebook requires a private profile. Social media are becoming a communication space in which business and private matters are discussed and addressed in equal measure. For some time now, they have been offering companies the opportunity to have a profile on platforms such as Google+ or Facebook and to maintain a direct dialogue with their customers. In doing so, they face numerous challenges: They must use social media in a strategically clear manner and maintain direct dialogue with customers. The surveys by Bernet and Namics on the use of social media in Swiss companies show that more and more Swiss companies are maintaining their own presence in social media and are increasingly doing so with a defined strategy. However, the surveys also show that only a few companies are making their own budgets available for the use of social media. In addition, the new media make new demands on the speed and type of communication. Private and business contacts take place in the same environment on the platforms. The tone is relaxed, the manners are uncomplicated, which in most cases contradicts the usual guidelines of corporate communication. In contrast to conventional corporate communication, the exchange via Facebook is fast, direct and transparent. Users can express their opinion on products and services from anywhere at any time. The posts and the company's reaction are public and social media are fundamentally geared towards interaction.

Cooperative networks of specialists will take the place of leading professions and this is also where the potential for generating the poetic will be found. The starting point is the thesis of the IS GaS that cooperative networks of specialists will take the place of leading professions. While in structures with a leading profession the potential for generating the poetic lies in the ""power of definition"" of the leading profession, this is not clearly defined in the design process of cooperative networks. Research question: Where is the poetic potential in the “building as a system”? Building Building parallels the “building as a system” with “interdisciplinary art research”. This art-based ""in vitro"" test arrangement has an exploratory character. From the question of where poetic potential lies in the interdisciplinary cooperative network of art research, conclusions can be drawn about the ""building as a system"". Such application of the poetic to research is a consequence of the development of art-based research. Here, the aesthetic categories that are introduced through the skills of art can open up new perspectives and methods. Expected relevant findings for the HSLU: For the IS GaS, it is shown where the poetic potential lies in cooperative networks. Methods and formats are tested for interdisciplinary art research which, through their poetic potential, initiate new innovation processes in the disciplines involved.

A highly installed base structure made of concrete serves as a container for modular research units and offers the opportunity to try out new forms of living and working, construction methods and technologies under real conditions. The units are developed specifically according to the research content, placed in the supporting backbone and replaced by other modules after the research is completed. People should live, work and spend their free time in the units. Electrochromic glasses are increasingly being used to protect against solar radiation. Their transmission properties can be changed by applying an electrical voltage. This process darkens the glass, but creates constant transparency to the outside, which is a clear advantage over classic blinds. Can electrochromic glass replace the blinds?

The experience-oriented marketing approach offers opportunities to work on the image with new products at the same time as increasing sales and winning new customers. In this approach, which originally comes from tourism, it is assumed that an experience is able to bind a customer more strongly and tends to increase his willingness to pay.

Switzerland serves as a benchmark market (highly developed, providing for a great variety of banks) against which performance of the V4 banks will be tested. Such approach enables us to comprehend the complexities of relationships among particular bank performance drivers. Besides our main goal, the project aims to address in more-details two up-to-date issues: 1.) impacts of financial crisis in developed and new economies; and 2.) procyclical and countercyclical impacts of capital requirements under the Basel regulation.

With the motif of ""transformation"" she takes up a motif that was central to the time around and during the First World War. In political history, the First World War not only marked the collapse of a world order that the majority felt was ""founded permanently"" (Stefen Zweig, ""Die Welt von Gestern""), but also a terrible turning point in the history of civilization, since European societies first broke with the principles of a civilized society that had been developing since the Enlightenment in the 18th century in a barbaric and irreversible way. On the other hand, in the years around the First World War, a variety of transformation processes manifested themselves in science, technology and art, which left formative traces not only in political history, but also in the history of European mentality and ideas as well as the history of culture and technology, especially with regard to the body and gender as well as on the level of materiality and mediumship. These are often highly branched and mutually dependent or influencing processes.

In a first step, a common basis for further planning should be found at round tables. The dialogue process with the various interest groups such as landowners, neighborhood residents and club representatives from the areas of townscape, landscape and nature conservation and representatives of political parties lasted from March 2017 to January 2018. A total of four round table events were held during this period . In a first step, one-on-one talks were held with a number of key stakeholders such as landowners, residents and representatives of associations and political parties. This enabled an arrangement at the first round table and showed that the disputed points are extremely varied. At the first round table, topics such as architecture, protection of the townscape and landscape, use and design of open spaces, amphibian networking, water protection, economic efficiency were discussed and the different meanings and evaluations of these topics by the stakeholders involved could be made visible. While at the second round table, among other things, the location and volume of possible new buildings based on variant sketches, which were prepared by a team of experts from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Technology & Architecture, the focus at the third round table was on the design and upgrading of open spaces and ecological networking. The purpose of the fourth round table was to bring together what has been discussed so far and to take stock of points of consensus and dissent. In this way, guiding principles could be formulated for the future further development of the Winkel core zone in points where convergence was achieved.

In order to investigate the comprehensibility of marketing communication for electricity products from renewable energies, the project pursued an interdisciplinary approach: We assumed that both communicative factors (e.g. comprehensibility of a text) and individual, target group-specific factors affect the purchase decision. The purchase decision for electricity from renewable energies depends on the interplay of communicative and individual factors. Whether consumers are willing to spend more money on an electricity product from renewable energy sources depends on their willingness to process information, their attitude and their conviction. These individual factors are in turn significantly influenced by communicative factors, such as whether one can read the text at all (keyword ""font size""), whether one understands the words used in it and whether one can link the content to one's own prior knowledge. If the potential buyers do not know a product and do not understand the advertising message, they cannot see the advantages and are therefore unlikely to be convinced of a purchase. Intelligibility cannot be examined in isolation from the context. With regard to communication for electricity products from renewable energy sources, two contextual factors must be taken into account: the involvement for electricity products and the information overload. The term product involvement describes the interest in and willingness to search for, absorb, process and store information about a consumer good in a targeted manner (Trommsdorff, 2009). Electricity is a low-involvement product. This means that the majority of consumers are not willing to process information about electricity products."," Janoschka Anja,  Schaffner Dorothea,  Federspiel Esther,  Kolberg Sonja,  Compondu Séverine,  Fries Tobias", Demarmels Sascha

Wolfgang Rihm, who was born on March 13, 1952 in Karlsruhe and thus not far from the Swiss border, has a close relationship with Switzerland as a place of activity and performance. The contributions collected in this publication shed light on the versatile and multifaceted presence of the composer and his work in Swiss musical life. The topography of this presence is determined by institutions such as the Lucerne Festival, the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra and the Paul Sacher Foundation, as well as numerous personal and often long-standing acquaintances and friendships with representatives of the Swiss music and cultural scene. In this context, acquaintance also means dealing with personalities such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Adolf Wölfli, who left their mark on Swiss intellectual life. In addition to scientific contributions (Thomas Gartmann on Rihm's Wölfli settings; Eleonore Büning on Rihm's compositions for Paul Sacher; Thomas Meyer on Rihm's examination of the symphonic works of Johannes Brahms, which was stimulated by the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra, from which the work Nahe fern emerged; Mark Sattler on Rihm's relationship to Nietzsche and the relationship to the Lucerne Festival and the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra; and Jürg Huber on the Swiss reception of Rihm's work) and a detailed interview with the composer Dieter Ammann, the publication also offers statements by artist friends such as Anne-Sophie Mutter and Michael Haeflige James Gaffigan and Jonathan Nott as well as a detailed overview of the performances of works by Wolfgang Rihm in Switzerland since 1980.",, Baldassarre Antonio

Development of concepts to increase awareness and thus inquiries for services of the Rheumaliga Lucerne and Unterwalden 1. Initial situation Rheumatism is generally regarded as a disease that causes pain in the joints. It is thought that older people are particularly affected. In reality, rheumatism is a highly complex autoimmune disease that can also affect children and adolescents. The treatment possibilities and options are very individual. Ignorance and false images mean that many sufferers are unable to take advantage of the best possible counseling and treatment options. The disease is also often associated with shame, which makes it even more difficult to find coping strategies for living with rheumatism. The Rheumaliga Luzern and Unterwalden would like to improve knowledge and information about rheumatism and offer those affected a personal point of contact. 2. Question The Rheumaliga in Lucerne and Unterwalden has a comprehensive range of courses for those affected. These are well organized and well attended. It is important to Rheumaliga Luzern and Unterwalden to become better known in the future and to be able to pass on more information about the development, prevention and treatment of rheumatism through personal contacts and to increase their awareness. A concept should be developed for this. 3rd goal After the implementation of the concept: - Those affected benefit directly and personally from the know-how and the support of the employees of Rheumaliga Luzern and Unterwalden. - Interested target groups such as representatives of family medicine, rheumatology, ergotherapy and physiotherapy, nutritional advice and orthopedics are well informed about the Rheumaliga offer. - the cooperation with the stakeholder groups (hospitals, pharmacies, drugstores, orthopaedists, ergo- and physiotherapy, Pro Infirmis, Pro Senectute) is very good. - the positive, active image of Rheumaliga Lucerne and Unterwalden is strengthened. - the Rheumaliga Lucerne and Unterwalden are well known to the general public. 4. Procedure The concept for achieving the above goal is developed together with those affected and interest groups. This can already increase the awareness of Rheumaliga, since it is perceived as an active and innovative organization that is committed to networking. This approach also has the advantage that everyone who is interested is “on board” and can critically monitor the proposed steps. This makes it easier to ensure that the concept has the correct ""flying altitude""."," Rindlisbacher Benjamin,  Müller Meike,  Fux Sarah", Gretler Heusser Simone

So far, however, there are hardly any approaches to designing communication in SMEs. 1. Disclosure of communication practices in SMEs and derivation of success factors Based on previous research results, hypotheses on communication in SMEs were derived, which were verified by analyzing the 782 data sets received (response rate 21%). The results show, among other things, the approaches of the SMEs in planning and organizing their communication as well as in its implementation and control and, in addition to the qualitative interviews, formed the basis for deriving success factors of the communication. Among other things, it was found that the SMEs examined coordinate their communication in particular formally and that a uniform appearance is positively related to the degree of awareness and the company image as well as the success of the SMEs in comparison to the industry. 2. Development of a communication model for SMEs On the basis of an analysis of existing communication models and the results of the investigation, a seven-point requirement profile for a communication model suitable for SMEs was first developed. For example, its simple use in companies with lower planning capacities was derived as a requirement.

The complex connections between forest, regional use of wood and added value for climate and society are not sufficiently anchored in awareness 31 percent of Switzerland's total area is forested. The forest is a defining part of the landscape and performs a variety of tasks: as a protective forest, as a place for recreation and leisure, and as a habitat for animals and plants. It thus contributes to biodiversity and takes on ecological functions as a water reservoir and air filter. In addition, the forest as a carbon store makes a contribution to climate protection. As an economic product of the forest, wood is an important part of Swiss building tradition and an important source of regional added value. The added value for society and the environment is manifold. But everyone involved in forest conservation is confronted with major challenges: increasing usage claims, increasing damage caused by extreme weather events, pests and diseases, rising costs for clearing damage or forest conversion. With volatile wood prices and weak points in the value chain, the economic concept of the forest is increasingly coming under pressure. So far, illustrations of the forest-wood value chain (and thus also the understanding) have focused on a linear flow from the delivery of the raw material wood to the finished building or to the wood energy supplied. The complex dependencies between the use of regional wood and the ecosystem services of the forest are not very visible to politics and society. This is where the ITC INNOwood project comes in. Instead of isolated, linear value creation considerations as a sales chain, a common picture of the complex effect structure of the forest-wood society is developed with a systemic approach. Based on new communication strategies, complex relationships are worked out using concrete case studies and clearly illustrated in user stories. The processing in INNOwood will represent previously abstract dependencies in an operationalizable way. The forest is included in its entire range of functions in the hitherto isolated consideration of the wood sales chain. Claims and functions towards society are recorded. INNOwood relies on the dialogue between research and practice. A link is drawn from the superordinate systemic consideration to the exemplary, practical illustration in a region. In order to ensure that it can be transferred throughout Switzerland, a comparison is made between regional influences and national validity. The results of the INNOwood project thus support the implementation of the Forest Policy 2020 throughout Switzerland. This project is being implemented with the support of the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), the Conference for Forests, Wildlife and Landscape (KWL), the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts as part of the Interdisciplinary Theme Cluster Space and Society (ITC RG), the Lignum Holzwirtschaft Zentralschweiz (LHZ), Pirmin Jung Schweiz AG and all cantons of Central Switzerland (Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Uri)."," Schultz Elke,  Malevez Jara,  Wacker Pascal,  Bucher Stefan,  Walker Timo J."," Geier Sonja,  Hanisch Christoph,  Witt Sabine"

When producing such contributions, the instruments of classic film production can only be used to a very limited extent. There is a lack of basics for planning and specifications for the production process. In addition, few narrative and mediation strategies are known that can be used as a reference for high-quality film productions in this area. In order to close this knowledge gap, the Visual Narrative research group at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, in cooperation with Swiss television, is investigating the specific conditions in the development and production of 360° film contributions. Specifically, research and business partners will jointly develop several prototypical 360° scenarios and explore the widest possible spectrum of design options with a focus on narrative and communication strategies. The resulting design suggestions for successful 360° productions are bundled in a quality-defining toolbox and explained using application examples. At the same time, a basis for the formulation of structured planning principles and an efficiency-enhancing production process should be created within this practical setting."," Vogelsang Axel,  Isabel Garcia Carlos,  Merkle Christophe,  Truniger Fred,  Frei Samuel"," Müller Robert,  Frei Samuel"

A 5kW system was built and successfully tested. Absorption heat storage systems have a high energy density and do not suffer any heat loss during the storage period. Instead of sensible heat, such as in a hot water tank, the absorption heat storage tank stores a heat pump potential to provide heat at elevated temperature from the environment. The storage tank is charged in summer using thermal or electrical energy, e.g. from solar thermal energy or PV power, and in winter it provides heating heat with almost no additional electricity; this from a low-temperature heat source, eg a geothermal heat exchanger or an air heat exchanger. The storage system serves as a virtual electric battery due to the significant reduction in the load on the power grid in winter. At the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU), such a storage system, based on aqueous caustic soda, is being researched and developed. This consists of a converter (the absorption heat pump) and a working media storage (conventional plastic container) and is flexible in terms of arrangement, performance and storage capacity. The working medium (caustic soda and water) is stored at room temperature without loss, with the concentration of the caustic determining the state of charge: in the discharged state it is diluted and in the charged state it is concentrated. The absorption heat storage tank achieves an energy density of around 280 kWh/m3 in the building, depending on the operating temperatures. This means that a heat capacity that is up to six times higher than that of a hot water tank is achieved."," Brun Peter,  Ammann Sebastian", Fumey Benjamin

The Departments of Design & Art and Technology & Architecture have therefore created the Sacred Landscape Central Switzerland platform. Major transformations are currently pending in the sacred landscape and especially in the monasteries of Central Switzerland. Many monasteries are looking for new ways into the future for demographic reasons. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts is therefore committed to the region with its interdisciplinary competencies in this area and regards this as part of its third mission. With its interdisciplinary competencies, the HSLU wants to sensitize and convey this to the sacred landscape as a (construction) cultural heritage, it wants to accompany and support the monasteries in the upcoming processes, and it wants to deal with the topic in research & development and in teaching . In the process, two themes emerged: Accompanying the transformation processes of the monasteries from the perspectives of building culture, material and immaterial cultural assets and regional planning perspectives (landscape) was identified as the first theme, the development of new and innovative educational formats from the tradition and from the implicit knowledge of the communal life of the monasteries against the background of digital transformation was the second topic. The first joint project deals with the Baldegg monastery, whose mother house will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2022. In 1972 the new Baldegg monastery was inaugurated as the mother house of the Baldegg sisters. The architect is Marcel Breuer, who was world famous at the time for the brutalist architecture he designed in his New York studio. Courses and a publication are planned in partnership between the HSLU and the monastery. How did the architect Breuer design the sacred architecture for the Baldegger sisters, what were the principles behind his design of the building and its interior design? How do architecture experts view Baldegg Abbey today? What can we learn from Baldegg Monastery today about space, outside and inside, silence and spirituality? A publication explores these questions by bringing together the voices of the monastery, architecture and art experts and theologians to create a multi-perspective picture of Baldegg Monastery on its 50th birthday. The monasteries of Central Switzerland are used as part of the platform in teaching as learning ecosystems in which new and innovative educational formats are developed. What potential do monasteries and their practices and rituals have for the present? What can students learn about the monasteries, their gardens and businesses in times of change? In cooperation with the monasteries and especially in local projects, garden projects are created that deal with ecology and the design of nature. The knowledge of the monastic traditions about spirituality, focus, rhythm is used for its benefit for the self-techniques of students in the current changing society in times of crisis."," Geissbühler Dieter,  Biechteler Heike,  Bürgin Matthias,  Müller Pablo,  Mader Rachel"," Christen Luther Gabriela,  Käferstein Johannes"

The SNSF project Seeking Birdscapes – Contemporary Listening and Recording Practices in Ornithology and Environmental Sound Art, led by Helena Simonett and Patricia Jäggi, aims to gain new insights into the relationship between (hearing) humans and nature. We assume that people perceive natural sounds such as bird calls differently depending on their personal biography. Furthermore, we assume that in addition to cultural factors, there are also geographical ones. There are numerous studies within an ecosystem (e.g. Amazon or Siberia), but no comparison of very different geographical environments within Europe, such as in regions of densely populated central and southern Europe (focus on Switzerland and Catalonia) and the sparsely populated island of Iceland. The project concentrates on a selected selection of people such as field ornithologists, sound artists or composers. The experience of bird calls and the imaginary worlds behind them are examined through interviews, sound recordings and observations in the field. We are also interested in whether and how listening experiences shape biographies and ultimately environmental awareness. Through the collaboration with the Sempach ornithological station, the BirdLife Lucerne Foundation and the Natural History Museum Lucerne, as well as the public presentation of our research, the project aims to raise social awareness of the characteristic soundscapes that surround us as an intangible heritage. The sub-project “Seeking Birdscapes & Interdisciplinary Art Mediation” was developed for this purpose.

The pilot project shows that early support for women with a low-threshold program triggers changes. Current scientific findings show that overweight and obesity (obesity) are more common in Switzerland than previously thought. The risk of overweight and obesity in childhood can already be pre-programmed in the womb, which is why targeted, preventive measures during pregnancy are most promising. This pilot project starts here. The aim was to support women who are severely or severely overweight (BMI ≥ 30) during pregnancy and afterwards to adopt a healthier lifestyle and get enough exercise. The focus was on intensifying the existing standard structures in support, without creating a new offer, and on involving the other specialists involved in the birth more intensively. The aim of the pilot project was also to contribute to the better networking of specialists who are already working in childbirth. The data was based on several qualitative interviews conducted at different times with pregnant women or mothers and their midwives. In addition, further surveys were carried out with the mothers' and fathers' advisors and an online questionnaire with gynecologists in the canton of Aargau and two experts * held internal discussions. In summary, the following results can be stated: - The more intensive support provided by the midwives and the relationship of trust that is established as a result are important elements for more effectively supporting overweight women, some of whom are already stigmatized. - Changes in diet and exercise behavior can be brought about, but they vary over the period of time. The earlier the women can be accompanied, the sooner a change can be initiated. - Addressing the topic of “overweight” turned out to be a greater challenge for most of the professionals surveyed. Various support measures are required here, such as more intensive further training in ""motivational interviewing"". - The pilot project used so-called ""sensitive windows"" with women to provide support before, during and after pregnancy. The results show that these are proving beneficial and that more such windows, particularly postpartum, exist. In order to be able to define these more precisely, there should be more intensive cooperation with the existing specialists in all aspects of birth and in the early childhood area, and support for women with an increased risk of being overweight should be intensified. The project team at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences – Social Work has drawn up various proposals to ensure that the pilot project is successfully converted into measures or, for example, to establish a low-threshold program for pregnant women with obesity.

The rope with its specific construction determines the deformation behavior of the rope cross-section (rigidity, transverse contraction), which influences the pull-off force. The permissible pressure loads on the rope surface and inside the rope (strength) as well as the tendency to tube formation essentially depend on the rope construction. The design of the clamping plate and in particular the shape of the jaws as well as the design of the contact surface between the two friction partners are factors that can be influenced by the designer.

The research project ""Musical relationship between alphorn and yodel - fact or ideology"" addressed the question of when, how and where both musical practices influenced each other. The research team relied on the evaluation of a large corpus of historical text and image sources, the documentation of historical alphorns, the analysis of sound recordings and an empirical survey on the perception of alphorn and yodelling melodies. Musical adoption processes can be based on a partial joint use of the natural series. The study area started in Switzerland and stretched across southern Germany and Austria. In the case of the Austrian Wurzhorner yodelers, the name alone indicates a connection to the instrument, and in the Muotataler 'Bücheljuuz' the yodeler imitates the sound of the instrument so skilfully that the difference between voice and instrument is hardly noticeable. However, not all types of yodelling have a musical relationship to the alphorn, and alphorn music is not always related to yodelling.

The focus of these considerations is the sustainable use of resources, as well as the operation of the building and the users. Different approaches to building assessment have developed from specific regional framework conditions. The different evaluation systems and models in the participating countries serve in CABEE as case studies for comparative analyzes and the exchange of experiences. The aim is to support the individual actors in politics, planning and implementation. CABEE shows the basis for decision-making. The public sector is to be strengthened in its role as a role model for the transformation of its own building stock, SMEs are to be motivated to make more use of new technologies and materials, and a better understanding of users in everyday building operations is to be created. At the same time, CABEE is expanding the focus from individual buildings to entire groups of buildings . There is potential for future optimization in the networking and the consistent exploitation of synergies in the building association. In the Synergy grids working group, the scenario development based on practical examples should provide impetus for future implementations. Different approaches to the assessment at building association level have been in development in some regions for a long time and are being discussed in more detail in order to provide arguments for the creation of the political and legal framework."," Ehrbar Doris,  Schultz Elke,  Koller Fabienne,  Schwehr Peter,  Schmickl Raphaela,  Haase Stefan,  Heim Thomas", Geier Sonja

As an alternative to conventional U-tube probes that work with water/glycol (brine), geothermal probes that use carbon dioxide (CO2) as the working fluid have been installed in Austria and Germany in recent years. These CO2 geothermal probes work on the principle of a gravitational heat pipe. The liquid CO2 runs down the pipe wall, evaporates while absorbing the geothermal heat and rises again in the middle of the pipe. Due to the automatic circulation, these probes do not require a circulation pump. They are therefore also called ""pumpless geothermal probes"". The aim of this study was to investigate the fluid and thermodynamic processes in a CO2 geothermal probe using a simulation model. The possibility of multiple injections of the working fluid should also be taken into account. In addition, the potential for increasing efficiency compared to conventional brine probes should be quantified.",, Wellig Beat

This process was moderated by Prof. Jürg Stettler, Head of the Institute for Tourism Management at the HSLU, and included a total of four workshops with participants from the following institutions and organizations: Municipality of Vitznau, Municipality of Weggis, Hotel Rigi-Kulm AG, IG Rigi, Landscape Protection Association of Lake Lucerne (LSVV Pro Rigi, Rigi-Bahnen AG, RigiPlus AG, Unterallmeind Arth and the association “Ja! zu Regina Montium” (formerly Rigi petitioners). In the four workshops, a joint idea of the future development of the Rigi was developed and systematically divided into subject areas (environment, economy, society). At the same time, the process was defined as to how future development projects on the Rigi are to be designed with the involvement of the stakeholders. In a multi-year development plan, important projects are jointly defined and provided with parameters and target values for sustainability monitoring. In this way, those affected and involved are informed about upcoming projects at an early stage and are actively involved in the development process. The charter was adopted by the organizations involved in autumn 2018, and people and organizations who were not previously involved were subsequently invited to sign the charter.

As Lucerne's municipal music director, Gustav Arnold was entrusted with the important musical offices. Significant for the place and time, he moved between dilettantism and professionalism, between artistic provincialism and foresight. His comprehensive estate bears witness to this, but it has not yet been processed. So far, Arnold's achievements have only been discussed briefly. That may come as a surprise, given that regional music research has intensified in Central Switzerland. The project focused on three aspects: firstly, Arnold's biography, secondly, his efforts to cultivate bourgeois music, and thirdly, his compositional work. The study thus makes a contribution to the music history of both the city of Lucerne and central Switzerland as a whole. A comprehensive text was published in the New Year's papers of the Historical Association of Uri, a specialist article on Arnold's function as a church musician in music and liturgy, while a CD with sound samples enclosed with the publication, two musical events (Pentecost service in Altdorf, MittWortsMusik in Lucerne), a small special exhibition in the Uri Historical Museum and a lecture at the invitation of the SMG Luzern made Arnold's work tangible on other levels as well."," Huber Jürg,  Camp Marc-Antoine", Koch David

The increasing number of medical service providers and the resulting oversupply of services are seen as the main reason for the steady rise in costs in outpatient medical care. The cantons are given the authority – and the responsibility – for controlling the oversupply or undersupply through approval control. However, there are no scientifically based criteria for appropriate care, and thus for a possible application of an approval freeze. The overarching goal of the “Criteria for outpatient care” project is to analyze the use of outpatient medical services and the effect of any controlling interventions on the supply side. The present project is intended to create a basis for the development of criteria for appropriate outpatient medical care and for assessing the effectiveness of admission control. It builds on preliminary work as part of the ""System Dynamics Vorprojekt ÖGM"" project and continues it on the basis of a specific, strongly focused question Disease"") and the amount of services for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases in the outpatient sector in the period 2000-2014. The treatment path should be taken into account (primary care or specialists) and a distinction should be made between rural and urban regions. At the same time, the corresponding developments on the supply side are examined. The data will probably relate to the canton of Bern. In preparation for a planned system dynamics model for the analysis of controlling instruments in outpatient medical care, a prototype is created which only contains factors from demography and epidemiology. This prototype aims to answer two questions: a) Can the development of the use of medical services be explained solely on the basis of epidemiology (burden of disease) and demography, or are other influencing factors to be taken into account? b) What use of medical services can be expected based on selected medical references (guidelines, foreign examples)? It is assumed that such a reference development corresponds to ""appropriate"" medical care. As mentioned, it is planned to develop an extended system dynamic model based on this prototype, which will probably also take into account other influencing factors on the supply side.

On July 15, 1861, the City Council of Lucerne decided to create the position of municipal music teacher and music director as of September of the same year. What was initiated back then - music lessons offered by the city outside of compulsory school - has developed into an important educational institution in Lucerne over the past 150 years. In order to trace the history of the music school in the city of Lucerne, source material from the State Archives and the City Archives of Lucerne as well as material from interviews with personalities who shaped the music school were used. The merger of Lucerne and Littau offered the opportunity to compare the development of the municipal institution with a school that emerged in the course of the music school euphoria of the 1970s. – A leitmotif in the 150-year history turned out to be the dispute with the canton regarding financing and influence on the educational offer, which led to the founding of the music school in the first place. The range of subjects, which was specifically examined, is closely related to financing. Further topics are parallels and divergences in the development of Littau and Lucerne as well as the situation of the music school in the respective social situation.

Depending on the canton of residence, the affected families incur costs of different amounts. Ambulatory help is recommended or arranged for families who can no longer cope with the family difficulties on their own. As a rule, the parents have to pay for the resulting costs. If they are unable to do so, the responsible authority will bear the costs, although these costs can be subsequently reclaimed from the parents. Due to the different social legislation in the cantons, families incur short-, medium- and long-term costs of different amounts depending on the canton in which they live. One of the most cost-intensive outpatient aids is social-pedagogical family support, which is the focus of the following. At least theoretically, the hypothesis, which has also been substantiated in practice, can be derived that families reject this outpatient help despite existing motivation for change because of their aversion to financial losses. For the children affected, the rejection of such outpatient help means that they lose important development time until the family difficulties escalate further and, as a result of the increased pressure, suitable educational support becomes necessary. Unfortunately, as time has passed, the likelihood that this parenting aid will prove effective decreases, as studies show. A research project should therefore investigate the extent to which a possible connection between costs and rejection or approval of socio-pedagogical family support can actually be statistically proven, or whether this connection is mathematically related to other variables."," Canonica Alan,  Masoud Tehrani Anoushiravan,  Habersaat Cathrin,  Ribaut Gabriela,  Mösch Peter", Metzger Marius

Appropriate planning approaches for open space development and their qualitative implementation will be needed in the future. The present research project starts with this problem and locates itself exemplarily in the metropolitan area of Zurich, in the agglomeration core communities and in small communities of urban character. The project aims to work out planning characteristics based on case studies in Rapperswil-Jona and Schlieren. These are then contrasted with the social and cultural studies perspective of the everyday, subjective perception and appropriation habits of the users. This leads to new interdisciplinary quality requirements as well as recommendations for action for open space planning practice."," Nägeli Bettina,  Litscher Monika,  Brombacher Simon,  Gäumann Simone"," Bezzola Franco,  Hömke Maik"

Based on the knowledge gained, need for improvement and measures can be formulated as to how promising projects, need for action and structures for sustainable development in the area of integration and prevention should be promoted or optimized. In a three-stage tool developed by the university, spatial, quantitative data on the social structure and on the institutions in the area of integration and prevention are presented. The evaluation of this data - modified depending on the research question - is carried out in a qualitative manner by means of interpretation and assessment by relevant specialists from institutions and selected local experts. This long-term tool not only forms a basis for the planning, evaluation and redesign of services in the area of prevention and integration, but can also be included in the respective analysis process for questions relating to various urban processes and developments. Or: A three-stage, GIS-based tool was developed in the ""Social Space Mapping Zofingen"" project. GIS stands for ""Geographical Information System"". This is based on different theoretical and methodological concepts and was tested in a first run in the city of Zofingen. Using this working tool, integrative and preventive services can be evaluated and planned in the medium and long term. The developed tool consists of three modules that are assembled and linked like building blocks. In the first two modules, spatial quantitative data sets on the social structure and from institutions are recorded and selected indicators are visualized as GIS representations. In the third module, qualitative data and interpretations by specialists and experts should be included in an integral and targeted manner in a participatory and discursive process. The innovation of the working tool developed lies above all in the sophisticated combination of methods, which ensures a binding combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The test run carried out in Zofingen has shown that regular use of the three-stage, GIS-based tool enables long-term social monitoring and sustainable social planning - especially in small and medium-sized towns without their own GIS department and statistics department.",, Litscher Monika

Driving force for the study: A key goal of the National Alcohol Program (NPA) for 2013-2016 is to reduce problem alcohol use and counteract its negative effects, including acts of violence. In 2007, on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), alcohol-related acts of violence in the canton of Berne were investigated by means of a survey among police officers.1 Based on this investigation, the FOPH would now like to obtain representative and in-depth knowledge of the subject of alcohol and violence in public spaces in Switzerland. For this purpose, the research team from Interface Political Studies Research Consulting and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Social Work was commissioned to carry out the present study. The core element of the study is an online survey of around 1,300 police officers in four selected regions, flanked by 19 interviews with experts and a literature and media analysis. The results of the study show that alcohol plays a significant role in certain acts of violence. The most common alcohol-related acts of violence were assaults, physical injuries, disputes, disturbances of the peace and damage to property. Descriptions of concrete incidents by the police officers enable the characterization of typical features of alcohol-related acts of violence in public spaces. Most often these take place in the context of nightlife, on weekends in nightlife areas, public places or the streets and in the cities. Typically, males are involved in smaller groups in the 19-24 and 25-35 age groups. However, women are also involved in a third of the incidents and around a quarter of the incidents were reported from a rural community or from the agglomeration. The study comes to the conclusion that the accompanying research into preventive measures should be intensified and that different methods should be combined for this purpose.

As far as the right. But what do working people in Switzerland say about this? To date, no representative survey has existed for this purpose. With the National Barometer on Equality, the perception of Swiss employees as to the actual level of equality has now been surveyed. On behalf of the SKG, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, in cooperation with gfs.bern, conducted a representative online survey in the summer of 2018, asking 1,852 employed persons between the ages of 18 and 65 about their perception of equality and equal pay. The results of the National Barometer 2018 of the SKG correspond to results from national and international surveys. The assessments of those surveyed as part of the National Gender Equality Barometer 2018 show: For the vast majority of those surveyed, the equality of men and women in the family, education and work, as required by the Federal Constitution, has not been achieved. Women rate equality as less achieved than men - in terms of equal pay, but also in management positions and in politics. 17% of women and almost 2% of men report having experienced sexual or sexist harassment at work. A good 8 out of 10 workers perceive a general wage inequality to the detriment of women. A third of those in employment suspect wage discrimination at their current job. For women, it is almost every second woman. As the number of employees in a company increases, internal wage discrimination is increasingly suspected. This assessment is most often expressed by people in lower and middle management positions. 98% of women and 88% of men are in favor of measures to improve wage equality. More than half of those in employment (57%) have felt discriminated against at work because of gender.

Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that people with disabilities can decide for themselves and freely choose where, how and with whom they want to live. In addition, they must not be obliged to live in special forms of housing. Disability insurance (IV) has various measures to promote self-determined living for people with disabilities.

As part of this project, the Federal Social Insurance Office (BSV) would like to have it examined as to how the clarification instruments for the helplessness allowance, the intensive care allowance and the assistance contribution can be optimized. In addition, the expediency of a more resource-oriented orientation of the clarification instruments should be clarified.

The respective strengths and weaknesses are identified in a comparative analysis. In a next step, it will be examined to what extent the clarification instruments of the IV can be further developed against this background. At the same time, the potential for increased coordination and harmonization of IV and canton instruments is to be explored in order to ensure better equal treatment in practice.

Uncertain. is she coming Yes! It is time to question interest rate risk management understanding, models and processes in order to prepare for the upcoming turbulence. This project aims to help with that. Asset and Liability Management (ALM for short) is a synonym for balance sheet management. The main objective is to protect them from the effects of unexpected changes in interest rates. The entire arsenal of modern risk management is used for this: identifying and quantifying risks, understanding customer behavior, pricing customer transactions in line with the risk, developing strategies, creating internal regulations, processes and instruments for dealing with them. Reserved contingency plans are also included. ALM spread in the 1990s. At that time, interest rates – and other economic variables as well – became more volatile. In addition, new economic theories and models emerged (such as Monte Carlo simulation and Value at Risk). Personal computers began their triumphal procession. The systematic risk management of large financial portfolios became possible. In the meantime, the world has also experienced several credit cycles and financial crises. Other topics have meanwhile dominated ALM: bubbles and credit crises, the global financial crisis, capital and liquidity provision, regulation. However, one major megatrend connects all of these topics: the secular trend towards ever lower, unrivaled low interest rates. Zero interest rates were unthinkable in the 1990s. Negative interest rates were unthinkable recently. Both are now a reality, and the new interest rate environment has turned business and risk models upside down. Balance sheet management has become more difficult. However, the greatest challenge is still ahead of us all: the trend reversal with the transition to a phase of rising interest rates. This turnaround in interest rates could be painful. When does she come? Uncertain. is she coming Yes! For several years, the SNB has been warning of the interest rate risks that would then erupt. But so far she remains a caller in the desert. This scenario seems rather uncomfortable to many other market participants. It fits into this picture that the capital requirements according to Basel III do not include the ALM interest rate risks from a regulatory point of view either.

This circumstance affects the functioning of organizations in general and companies in particular in several ways. On the one hand, there are new opportunities, for example through better addressing and more targeted support for customers who are also aging. On the other hand, the abilities of employees change with age, ie older employees are less able to carry out certain activities than younger people, but on the other hand they also have strengths that younger people do not have. Due to this fact, the prevailing wage systems and the social security systems in Switzerland, people with increasing age have significantly more difficulty finding a new job because, compared to younger people, the labor costs are higher on the one hand and the employment of older employees on the other is often considered to be more limited.

The preliminary project funded by the EBGB and underlying this project, entitled ""Knackpunkt CRPD: Instrument for (self-)checking the CRC conformity of institutions on the subject of sexuality, contraception and the desire to have children of people with cognitive impairments"" aims to provide equal and self-determined access to these fundamental human rights of people with cognitive impairments and at the same time to promote and ensure the sensitization and guidance of professionals with regard to the implementation of the CRPD. The project submitted for funding (funding contribution for R&D projects of the HSLU) is about deepening women-specific questions on the right to self-determination in the area of sexuality within the project financed by the EBGB. Above all, women with cognitive impairments are particularly at risk of their right to self-determination in the areas of sexuality, contraception and the desire to have children and protection against sexual violence being ignored. They are at double risk due to gender and the presence of impairments. The special danger and the special needs of women with cognitive impairments cannot be further deepened within the framework of the preliminary project financed by the EBGB.

Topics such as contraception, the desire to have children and sexual violence have a decisive influence on the quality of life of women with cognitive impairments and their opportunities for self-determined sexuality. In these topics, a women-specific analysis can enable a meaningful and practice-relevant deepening. The aim of the deepening is the development of a women-specific part of the checklist for checking the CRPD conformity of institutions in the field of sexuality, contraception, the desire to have children and sexual violence.

Neighborhood espionage is a common method in socio-spatial urban development to make children's perspectives visible and thus enable children to participate. On the way to becoming a child-friendly community (unicef label), the city of Wil decided to carry out neighborhood espionage with children from three school buildings. Socio-cultural animation students (project intervention module) accompanied the groups of children and documented the neighborhood espionage. Neighborhood espionage We understand neighborhood espionage to be structured neighborhood inspections based on Deinet and Krisch (2009)[1]. Groups of children are accompanied by adults who document what the children say. A class of students from Socio-Cultural Animation accompanied the children in twelve groups of five girls resp. Jacks through three quarters. Aim The neighborhood espionage has a three-fold aim: They enable effective participation, i.e. participation and involvement of the children involved. Knowledge about children's perspectives can be generated. The procedure is embedded in a social space-oriented approach. Affected people become active when we connect our work to their living environment and their resources come into play. Procedure Selection of the school buildings in three quarters by the project team (City of Wil/University of Lucerne). Information for school management and colleges. Formation of the groups by teachers and the school administration: four groups per school building. The groups were divided into girls and boys and according to age into “smaller” (kindergarten to 2nd grade) and “bigger” children (3rd to 6th grade). Implementation of neighborhood espionage, which the students documented in keyword reports and with photos. In addition to the children's statements about ""good"" places that they like and ""bad"" places that they are afraid of or avoid for other reasons, the adults also noted their observations. Break and exchange for all children in their school building, sticking dots on the district plan. Results The results show consistent themes for the children from all quarters. However, there are also quarter-related differences: the children like all quarters. In all quarters there are places where the children can meet. Nature and animals are important to children. Traffic and roads are an issue in all quarters. The children appropriate the space in all quarters, but differently. Playgrounds are especially important for smaller children (Kiga, lower school). Privacy and public life are experienced differently in the quarters. [1] Ulrich Deinet, Richard Krisch: District inspection.

The project examines the entrepreneurial opportunities that digital business models open up for Swiss women and the special challenges that arise as a result. At first glance, digital business models are able to enable female founders to do what many women lack in the working world today: a lot of flexibility, good compatibility of different areas of life, creative freedom and a meaningful job. Digitization opens up new opportunities for women in particular, such as the growing commercialization of the lifestyle blogosphere. In order to use these advantages for themselves, digital female founders rely on highly specialized skills and abilities as well as on the so-called ""everyday expertise"". In the latter context, storytelling about one's own everyday life plays a central role. In this sense, not only new, but also particularly diverse opportunities for entrepreneurial activity seem to arise from digitization. At the same time, these new opportunities also result in new challenges - especially for digital female founders. So today we do not know to what extent these digital business models ultimately further cement the existing differences between male and female founding behavior. Here, the trend towards growth-limited individual companies could continue to intensify. This trend, in turn, prevents many female founders from accessing numerous funding instruments and professional investors who focus primarily on technology-intensive and growth-oriented start-ups (cf. Women Report, GEM 2017). Against the background of the social and economic relevance of these questions, it is hardly surprising that the topic of ""woman entrepreneurship"" or female founders is currently enjoying increased media attention and is also establishing itself as an important field of research in entrepreneurship research. So far, however, there has been a lack of scientifically based studies in Switzerland that shed light on the current and potential consequences of the digital transformation for female founders in Switzerland. This is where the Digital Female Founders research project comes in. The knowledge gained should serve to develop adequate support programs for digital female founders, because Switzerland still does poorly in international comparison when it comes to the specific support of female founders."," Da Rui Gena,  Oehri Isabelle"," Oldenziel Sylvie,  Da Rui Gena,  Oehri Isabelle,  Fontana Valentina"

This promotes energetically high-quality products as well as good indoor air quality in classrooms. Due to the high occupancy rate in classrooms, air exchange accounts for a significant proportion of the heating requirement in school buildings. Natural ventilation, which leads to an appropriate indoor air quality and is also energy-efficient, can only be implemented to a limited extent. In a typical classroom, for example, forced ventilation would have to be carried out every 20 minutes so that the CO2 content does not rise above 1500 ppm. The SVLW's “My Room Air” campaign provides, among other things, information and measuring devices for this type of ventilation. Due to the typical room sizes and room occupancy, it is therefore obvious to use mechanical ventilation with heat recovery in classrooms. In the case of existing school buildings in particular, devices that are installed in the room itself are primarily considered. It has been shown that such classroom ventilation devices are also suitable for new buildings, since the air distribution is eliminated or at least greatly simplified.

In addition, the attractiveness of the HSLU as a cooperation and research partner is strengthened and a distinction from competing institutes is achieved. A central element of the robotics platform can be found in the software framework. With ROS - Robot Operating System (http://www.ros.org/) - a large conglomeration of tools and methods of modern robotics research was created in academic research years ago. A joint initiative between American (Southwest Research Institute) and European (Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation) interest groups supported by industry is now striving to promote these tools of industry as ""ROS-Industrial"" (http://rosindustrial.org/) to make accessible. This means that a clean version control of the source code and a cleanup and reconciliation of the individual packages must be carried out. The overall goal of this initiative is to achieve the portability of software between the different hardware platforms so that functions do not have to be constantly reprogrammed and translated from system to system. This would significantly reduce integration costs at system level and could help keep the manufacturing industry in Switzerland with cost-effective automation solutions. An attempt to install the software on an HSLU robot (ABB IRB120) showed how far the project had progressed. The revised ROS-I packages are freely available.

Due to the radical changes, parents-to-be usually experience the transition to parenthood when their first child is born as challenging. In the case of groups at risk, this transition to parenthood is fortunately more likely to be accompanied by stabilization than destabilization despite the challenges ahead. These stabilization tendencies are commonly explained with the assumption of parental responsibility and the incompatibility of the previous risky behavior with the parental role. From a resilience-theoretical perspective, however, this stabilization can only occur if there is a favorable constellation of risk and protective factors in the family system. In particular, problematic attachment experiences of the expectant parents with their own parents prove to be an important risk factor here, since attachment patterns, once acquired, are passed on stably from generation to generation, i.e. they influence the attachment to their own children. The support of the particularly vulnerable expectant parents and their children is realized by means of an offer for the earliest possible support. In the prenatal phase of pregnancy, parents who are unsure about their attachment are recorded and assigned to a special parent-child program. On the one hand, this parent-child offer aims to support parents in building bonds with their children and, on the other hand, to make it easier for parents and their children to access existing early support offers. The pilot project is being implemented at the cantonal hospitals of Aarau and Baden, which means that potentially all parents-to-be living in the canton of Aargau can be reached. No parallel structures to existing offers should be created, but rather the access to these offers should be facilitated.

What is the relationship between the professional support environment of anthroposophically oriented institutions and this process? Due to a deficient image of humanity, people with disabilities often have the experience of being discriminated against and marginalized to this day. For this reason, the visibility and recognition of the contributions made by people with disabilities for social coexistence is of central relevance. Within the framework of this project, the first question is about the essential contribution made by people with disabilities to their social environment. It is assumed that their effect in terms of a resonance experience is significant and can open up new perspectives and important impulses in overcoming current social challenges of living together. In addition, the second question arises as to the connection between this development process and the ethical self-understanding and human image of anthroposophically based curative and social education (also called social therapy). This is being examined more closely because anthroposophically oriented contexts are based on a self-image that focuses on equal encounters at eye level and making the contributions of people with disabilities visible as part of their professional activities. The knowledge gained should help to increase the social and equal recognition of people with disabilities and thus counteract prejudices, misconceptions and the disadvantages associated with them. In addition, the study presents an inventory of the professional ethical self-image and the practical work of the professional accompanying environment. To answer the research questions, qualitative interviews are conducted, which take place in the context of anthroposophically oriented institutions. On the one hand, people with disabilities and, on the other hand, employees of anthroposophically oriented institutions are interviewed."," Fiala Elisa,  Adler Judith,  Zambrino Natalie,  Georgi-Tscherry Pia,  Calabrese Stefania"," Hess Ricarda Corina,  Hess Ricarda Corina"

From didactic research in the natural sciences, numerous pre-teaching ideas of learners (so-called pre-concepts) about electrical circuits, often shaped by everyday theories, are known, which must be taken into account for successful teaching. These can impede understanding and lead to misconceptions, e.g. B. the concept of consumption of electricity or the lack of consideration of the circuit as a system. models, e.g. B. the bicycle chain model or various water models, are intended to support understanding through various visualizations, but can in turn cause misconceptions and only explain certain aspects of the electrical circuit. As part of the project, an augmented reality application is being created to add various visualizations to circuit modules interactively and in real time. Learners can assemble fully functional building blocks into circuits - using a tablet, the current is then displayed directly on these building blocks according to the selected model. We promise ourselves that the use of these building blocks and thus the creation of a ""real"" circuit promotes experience and enables the flexible creation of new circuits. This is therefore a clear added value compared to a simulation on the computer (through the real components) but also animation and graphics (through interactivity). Augmented Reality is intended to take on an intermediary function between perception, mental and physical models.

Former factory buildings are being turned into apartments, an old car garage is being turned into a restaurant with a cinema and exhibition space, and an indoor swimming pool that is no longer in use is being transformed into a cultural center and filled with new life. These are just a few examples of the numerous conversions and temporary uses that are currently being created in the cities and that can represent great potential for existing buildings and the surrounding quarter. Room typologies that were once developed for specific uses experience a rededication of their spatial value through the conversion of the use layer. The Naked SPACE arises when the original function and use has become obsolete due to social, economic and technical developments and instead of leaving the building empty or demolishing it, it is necessary to find a new use. The task of the interior design is, with a ""re-dressing"", resp. to find an answer to the new needs of the users with the corresponding installations and equipment and to create a meaningful relationship between the new and the existing, which conveys identity and generates added value for the place. In the case of a change of use or temporary use, the question arises as to how far the function of the rooms should be predetermined or whether, in view of our fast-moving world, which constantly brings changes, rooms should be created that allow a wide variety of uses and functions. In this sense, a Naked SPACE is conceivable as an open space that users can appropriate themselves. In the Naked SPACE symposium, various concepts of conversion and temporary use and their conceptual and creative implementation will be presented and the question of how the interior design with the ""re-dressing"" of Naked SPACES create identity and thus contribute to added value for the location or the quarter can.

This is justified, among other things, by the fact that the ski area connection leads to an increase in the number of kilometers of pistes and this can result in a more varied offer for guests, which can have a positive impact on demand. A potential analysis also showed that this ski area connection could increase the number of skier days (so-called skier days) by around 6%, which could mean additional income of around CHF 2 million per year for the mountain railways. If 250 new beds are created in each area in addition to the current number of overnight stays, the skier days could increase by around 11%, which could mean additional traffic revenue of CHF 3.5 million per year for the mountain railways. In addition, demand gains in the hotel and non-hotel sector are to be expected. This increase in demand for tourism due to the possible merger of the three ski areas should be reflected against the background of the new traffic and the current and future traffic situation.

From our point of view, a regular review of the quality of service provision from the user's perspective is an important organizational goal of inpatient educational facilities, since the results generated in this way can not only be used to continuously improve the respective organization, but also to recognize the committed performance of the employees. In addition, the regular survey of user perspectives also gives young people and their parents an opportunity to exert influence. Such opportunities to influence the service provision of inpatient facilities have a proven positive effect on the acceptance of the prescribed measures, which in turn can then have a positive effect on working with the clientele. It goes without saying that it must not be forgotten that the sole aim of institutions providing in-patient educational support cannot be to satisfy clients, since the quality of professional services cannot be adequately assessed from a layperson's point of view. Nevertheless, the clientele can determine whether their expectations of previously positively experienced help processes can be covered by the help they have received within the existing structure. In addition, a sufficiently reflected clientele can also assess the usefulness of assistance if they have gained new skills to master situational challenges through this assistance. Finally, it must also be considered that possible conclusions from the satisfaction survey for the quality assurance of the youth village have to take into account the systemic orientation of the pedagogical work in the youth village, which is why, in addition to the questioning of the individual young people, only through the supplementary questioning of the youth council, parents and referring bodies as well as through additional information from the youth village itself, a comprehensive picture of the quality of service provision can emerge.",, Metzger Marius

The proportion of 60.7% home ownership is very high, both in a cantonal and Swiss comparison. According to LUSTAT (Yearbook 2012), the proportion of home ownership in Switzerland is around 35% and in Canton Schwyz around 46%. The rather higher proportion of home ownership in more rural cantons is typical. Many people consider their home to be age-appropriate or think that it is relatively easy to redesign it to make it age-appropriate. In addition, a change of residence would have to offer the following: proximity to public transport and the center, barrier-free living, reduction of house and garden work. Neighborhood help This topic involved, on the one hand, an inventory of the neighborhood help already provided or the commitment within the family (caring relatives), and, on the other hand, the clarification of the probable future need. The motivation for volunteering in the district is diverse: helping other people (45.9%), contact with people from other generations (35%) and fun (27.9%) are mentioned most frequently. Some of the respondents are already volunteers resp. volunteers, many could imagine such a commitment in the future. The vast majority of those surveyed (80.9%) would find it good if neighborhood help in the district were systematically structured and organised. Level of information In the last part of the survey, it was asked whether the institutions in the district that deal with age issues were known. It was also asked whether various documents such as wills, advance directives, living wills are known and whether the respondents have such documents at their disposal.

COOP Switzerland wants to strengthen these activities and commissioned a team from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to provide technical support. Initial situation Employees at COOP Switzerland are also challenged by cost pressure, demographic developments and the associated shortage of specialists and managers. The demands on executives are becoming more and more complex, both socially and economically. The condition for coping with these requirements is the performance of the employees. The basis for this is the physical and mental health of the employees. COOP Switzerland takes this development into account in the context of sustainable personnel management - beyond the well-established statutory health protection - by means of targeted health-promoting measures. In the knowledge that motivated and valued employees can meet the challenges, COOP Switzerland takes measures that enable the design of health-promoting working conditions for individual employees. With the aim of strengthening activities in the area of company health management (BGM) and sustainable personnel management, COOP Switzerland has commissioned the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to provide technical support for the BGM project. Goals The goal is to promote the health of employees at COOP Switzerland. This goal is to be achieved with the development and development of systematic company health management (BGM) and its sustainable integration into the processes and structures of COOP Switzerland. Implementation and results The project team examined the operational resources and workloads of the employees using various analysis methods such as a WHM self-assessment, oral employee surveys and the analysis of operational key figures. The existing WHM measures at COOP Switzerland were also surveyed. A WHM concept proposal was developed from the analysis results, which was validated with the HR managers at COOP Switzerland. In 2011, COOP Switzerland implemented the first WHM measures from this. Corresponding projects are currently taking place in case management, at the workplaces in sales and as part of further training."," Schaufelberger Daniel,  Näpfli Keller Nadine", Basler Monica

Initial situation The initial situation at Datwyler Cabling is currently such that the production facilities function with partial automation. The manufacturing process works in principle, but with information gaps. Starting with the incoming order, which is entered in SAP (ERP system). The necessary materials are then ordered for order processing. When the basic materials are delivered to Datwyler, an incoming goods inspection is only carried out to a limited extent. The recording of the materials received is incomplete and sometimes does not take place at all. If materials for the manufacturing process are then added to production, the information on the materials is not available, which later leads to massive information problems in the event of a production error within a batch. It takes a lot of effort to find out where, with which materials in which production step the error occurred. This results in a clarification process that is no longer up-to-date and, due to the high costs and time required for Datwyler, is also unacceptable. The traceability of raw materials is currently being developed in a project. In addition, delays in setting up between the sub-processes are the order of the day as a result of production not being optimally controlled. Datwyler asks itself how the recording of the components, semi-finished products, etc. within the individual sub-steps can be designed in such a way that the time and cost factors can be kept as low as possible in order to achieve agile and efficient production that fully meets customer needs . What (software) solutions are there on the market that can be integrated into the existing software architecture? What software can be expanded to be networked with any new software in the future? In view of this problem, the question arises as to where the “human” factor is. When Datwyler further automates and digitizes the end-to-end process so that Datwyler is able to know at all times exactly what stage of production an order is in, which basic materials and which semi-finished products are in place, the ""human"" factor comes into play. a central role in the whole system. Where will people be in the future? What tasks do humans have in an automated and digital world? Management is aware of these questions and is looking for approaches to address them proactively. Motivation Achieving increased effectiveness and efficiency in order to secure the long-term security of the production location Switzerland. The topics of added value, sustainability and job security are the focus. Project goals Recording of the problem and interpretation of the possibilities for improvement driving factors within the production process (end-to-end analysis)."," Wandeler Bernard,  Näther Caroline,  Steiger Olivier,  Meier René"," Kirchhofer Pierre,  Minonne Clemente"

In order to prepare this long-term study, the project team is conducting qualitative interviews with experts. Initial situation The importance and practice of internal communication in companies have changed significantly. There are several reasons for this: On the one hand, companies are increasingly using dialogue-oriented channels such as social media. For example, if the CEO maintains a blog on the intranet and employees can respond to it with comments, this will have an impact on management communication in the medium term and on corporate culture in the long term. The dialogue orientation of these channels increases the possibilities and thus also the importance of internal communication in companies. On the other hand, the growing relevance of internal communication is a consequence of globalization and complex organizational structures, which entail numerous change processes. If employees are to support changes, they must be informed and involved accordingly. In view of the increasing competition for qualified employees, internal communication is also an important element in motivating employees and binding them to the company. Aims of the project The change outlined here and the increasing relevance of internal communication are to be analyzed in a long-term study in order to be able to develop strategies for future-oriented internal communication in Swiss companies based on the empirical data. The aim of the preliminary study is to have experts assess the status quo and the changes in internal communication in Switzerland. Country-specific features are also of interest, which arise in Switzerland, for example, due to the small size and the different language areas and cultures. Project schedule The qualitative interviews with the experts will take place until January 2016. The qualitative preliminary study will be evaluated by April 2016. The first quantitative survey is planned for autumn 2016."," Gasser Brigitte,  Albert Daniel,  Boenigk Michael,  Kirchhof Samuel", Jecker Constanze

Background Empirical research in social work (social work/social pedagogy) has grown enormously in recent years in terms of thematic diversity and the number of publications in German-speaking countries. In addition to theoretical contributions, empirical investigations are therefore increasingly part of the self-image of a reflective, critical science of social work. However, there are only a few studies with an empirical research design in the field of sociocultural animation. Against the background of these developments, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has defined the topic of ""socioculture"" as one of its research priorities for the next few years. It is important to expand this focus even further and to link applied basic research more closely with teaching and the professional profile. Goals in sub-project 2: Application-oriented basic research Generating research questions and project ideas for broader-based, application-oriented basic research in the field of socio-cultural project work. Further expand and consolidate the scientific development in the research focus ""Socioculture"" at the Institute for Sociocultural Development. Initiate publication activity in the field of empirical research. 1-2 develop larger research projects to input maturity. Networking with the research community that is close to socioculture and clarifying possible collaborations for research projects. Implementation For the strategic development of the research focus on socioculture, it is planned to research the practice of animation empirically within the framework of smaller studies, primarily using qualitative methods. In addition to the traditional, socio-cultural fields of work such as open child and youth work, one focus is on newer professional environments from the areas of age and generations as well as community, urban and regional development. In addition, a compilation and evaluation of international empirical research literature on central concepts/topics of socio-cultural animation will take place. Organizational sciences, professional sociology and ethnomethodological studies of work should provide theoretical impetus for research on socioculture."," Willener Alex,  Bodammer Alexa,  Nägeli Bettina,  Bezzola Franco,  Jung Jasmin,  Störkle Mario,  Müller Meike,  Ehret Rebekka,  Gäumann Simone,  Meyer Simone", Kirchschlager Stephan

Initial situation In the wake of Zurich's dynamic development, Schlieren is experiencing rapid population and job growth. The district of Schlieren Südwest with its approximately 6,000 inhabitants is a model for this development. Many new settlement and infrastructure buildings are in the planning stage or have been implemented. Schlieren Südwest has a heterogeneous, multicultural socio-spatial structure. There is a tendency towards increasing socio-spatial segregation of the various immigrant groups and the long-established Schlieremer. In addition, Schlieren Südwest is characterized by a lack of opportunities for encounters and public spaces that are not very usable. In view of this increasing diversity and heterogeneity, the integration of different social classes and milieus is becoming a central task of urban development. With the “Schlieren Südwest – Shaping the Future” project, the city of Schlieren is pursuing the goal of actively shaping development for a good coexistence and a sustainable improvement in the quality of life in the Schlieren Südwest district. The Institute for Socio-Cultural Development at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts supports the city of Schlieren in process development and operational process support. Objectives Active involvement of the population as experts for the development of their living environment and district Promotion of the identification of the residents with their environment Formation of social networks as self-supporting structures Promotion of intercultural communication Strengthening of public spaces and promotion of the diverse use of public spaces Creation of meeting places and meeting opportunities Upgrading of the Kesslerplatz with its central functions and the Färberhüsliwiese as a meeting place and local recreation Socio-spatial integration of the future stops of the Limmattalbahn Bundling of administration resources by means of cross-departmental cooperation and support from a district management Implementation and results The broad-based participation project was started with a kick-off event in autumn 2012. Residents of Schlieren Südwest have explored their district themselves with interviews, group discussions and inspections, a storytelling workshop with older residents and a workshop for young people. Over 150 residents of different age groups from 12 to 94 years and from different backgrounds actively participated. From spring to autumn 2013, residents of the neighborhood worked in seven working groups on the central fields of action derived from participatory research and developed short-term, easy-to-implement measures as well as medium- and long-term project ideas, which in turn were presented to the general public and are now in independently or in cooperation with the city.

Initial situation In connection with the reorganization of financial equalization and the division of tasks between the Confederation and the cantons (NFA), the Federal Assembly passed the Federal Act on Institutions for the Promotion of the Integration of Disabled Persons (IFEG) on October 6, 2006. Based on the IFEG, the canton of Zurich has laid down in law the planning of a needs-based offer to support adult disabled people. At the end of 2006, the Cantonal Social Welfare Office in Zurich commissioned a project team from the Lucerne School of Social Work to draw up the inventory of offers and the lists of caregivers as the basis for needs planning. Based on these two sets of data, the project team worked with the cantonal social welfare office to draw up the planning report for the 2011 to 2013 period. This planning report now covers the subsequent planning period from 2014 to 2016. Implementation and results The forecast is based on the following points: the previous development trend, the newly developed forecasting method and the expected developments in the coming years, which were determined in an expert hearing.

Background In Albania, young men and women from marginalized groups are increasingly excluded from vocational training and from the labor market. Marginalized groups are young people from Roma and Egyptian communities in particular, but also young people who have not completed school, young people with a physical disability or young people from precarious socio-economic backgrounds. In the previous projects AlbVet (2010-12) and Coaching for Employment (2012-14), the HSLU - SA successfully trained 40 employees from NGOs to become coaches, who accompanied around 600 young people in vocational training or employment. Since 2015, the National Employment Services in Albania have also provided coaching for young job seekers from marginalized groups. In order to be able to offer this coaching, the HSLU – SA, based on the experiences and successes of the projects 2010-2014, is training twenty-four employees of the employment offices to become coaches, who in turn train groups of 10 young people in the employment offices over a period of 9-12 months accompany. In coaching, the young people are supported in finding their way on the job market, identifying their own interests and developing personal, social, methodological and specialist skills. The main goal is to improve young people's ability to connect to the training and labor market. Aims 1. The young people taking part know their interests but also the requirements of the working world and can correctly assess themselves in relation to these. 2. Young people have acquired personal, social, methodological and specialist skills through the program, which increase their chances of being employed or doing further training. 3. The employees of the National Employment Offices have the technical and methodological skills and abilities to accompany groups of young people into employment or vocational training. 4. After completion of the project, the coaching offer will be continued independently by the national employment offices and is anchored in the service offer of the national employment offices. Implementation and results From May 2015 to December 2016, 24 employees of the National Employment Services (NES) will be trained as coaches. After completing the training, the coaches receive a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. During the training, the coaches are already working with groups of 10 young people in the regional employment offices. By the time the training was completed, 400 young people had taken part in the coaching."," Glaser Jain Beatrice,  Rindlisbacher Benjamin,  Wandeler Bernard,  Regli Flavia,  Amenda Ina,  Kyburz Stefanie", Stade Peter

The project examines market acceptance and develops the model until it is ready for the market. Initial situation Many Swiss people have a great desire to own their own home. Despite this clearly demonstrated need, the home ownership rate is relatively low in an international comparison at 37.5% (for 2014 according to the BFS). One of the main reasons, in addition to the fact that Switzerland has attractive tenancy law, is the high financial requirement for the purchase of residential property. Many households do not have the minimum equity of 20% of the real estate value, which is required by the banks when granting a mortgage. At the same time, however, the desire to own a home often only exists in a certain phase of life – for example, from starting a family until the children move out. However, home ownership can also become a burden in old age, and many older people face problems when they want to sell their house or apartment. Temporary home ownership as a new form of ownership promises a solution to both challenges. How temporary home ownership works Temporary home ownership is a new form of ownership. As the name suggests, ownership is limited to a predetermined period of time (such as 30 years) which, due to familial or other life cycle circumstances, usually corresponds to the effective useful life of the property. As with traditional ownership, home ownership is entered in the land register. The acquirer thus has full ownership rights during the specified period of time. However, after the specified period of time, the residential property reverts to the ownership of the investor. Further development of the model until it is ready for the Swiss market With the exception of one property in the Bern agglomeration, temporary home ownership is not practiced either in Switzerland or abroad. This innovative form of home ownership represents a very attractive and forward-looking alternative to conventional home ownership, especially in Switzerland. The Institute for Financial Services Zug IFZ of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts is examining the market acceptance of temporary home ownership for Switzerland as part of a research project supported by the federal government together with well-known business partners and is further developing the model until it is ready for the market."," Barmettler Miriam,  Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne"," Wanzenried Gabrielle,  Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne"

And what benefits do these families see in the offer? Initial situation As for other offers of early support, little is known about the accessibility of socially disadvantaged families through the offer of mothers and fathers counseling. The Swiss Association of Counseling for Mothers and Fathers is therefore running a project to increase the accessibility of socially disadvantaged families. Objectives Within the framework of this project, an evaluation should provide insights into this question. The statistical analysis of the counseling data from nine mothers' and fathers' counseling centers in German-speaking Switzerland should provide information on the proportion of socially disadvantaged families in mothers' and fathers' counseling and which groups are reached and how well. In group discussions with mothers' counsellors, it is discussed which forms of organization are particularly useful for (risk) families. And in order to determine reasons for the use of the offer or the forgoing of long-term counseling from the point of view of the families, a special evaluation from the study ""Offers of early support in Swiss cities (AFFiS)"" of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences - Social Work and the Institute for School and elementary pedagogy created. In a second step, the results of the study are validated by experts.

ASRS runs as an APP on a smartphone/tablet and analyzes pronunciation and visible articulators (3D lip and chin position) of the patients. From this, ASRS uses machine learning methods to calculate instantaneous and personalized feedback and displays the necessary articulation corrections via a GUI. This currently represents an absolute unique selling point for such SW products. In the context of a previous project, the essential research questions and technological problems could be solved and the next step would be market entry. However, the course of the project has resulted in the following possibilities for improvement, the consideration of which would be important for an optimal market entry: Analysis of the pronunciation: Currently, this is still quite rough on the basis of entire practice sentences or (longer) words. This is to be refined down to the level of the individual phones (sounds). Analysis of the visible articulators: The camera (Intel RealSense) currently used for the 3D analysis is not product-capable. GUI: The current user interface is not yet adequate for the special needs of language rehabilitation Approach With so-called phonological features, very fine pronunciation errors can be analyzed down to the level of the individual phones, as comparisons of native and foreign speakers have shown. A reliable statement for this in the context of language rehabilitation is still missing. This is to be realized as part of this project. With the iPhone True Depth Camera, a new technology is available that can be integrated into the ASRS SW. As part of a research project, the user interface is currently being optimized (until Q1 2020), the results of which are integrated into the ASRS SW become"," Caduff Andreas,  Obrist Corsin,  Hofstetter Jonas,  Sadamori Leyna,  Rechsteiner Martin", Zahn Klaus

This is where the project comes in with the aim of examining and optimizing the possibilities of tokens in real estate investments. Initial situation and scenario Switzerland assigns high priority to blockchain and token issues. This is manifested in numerous projects and initiatives: First, the legal framework enables the use of the technology and specifically defines the requirements for tokens in various application areas. Furthermore, the technology cluster Switzerland and in particular Zug (Crypto Valley Zug) has a high affinity to this topic and enables a technological implementation and further development of the technologies. The possible applications were further strengthened with the adjustment of the institutional framework in summer 2021, especially in the area of ""tradability"". In this context, the technology has already been applied in numerous areas (including currencies). The ""real estate management"" area represents a particularly targeted area of application of the technology. This includes numerous areas of the life cycle of a property (including land register, investment, management). Furthermore, due to its size, the area is relevant for further investigation. At the same time, there has only been partial widespread acceptance of the technology in the real estate industry to date. As a result, a number of pilot projects have been successfully implemented (including ""Hello World"" in Baar, with the support of the IFZ, or ""Bahnhofstrasse Zürich"") and some fund structures (including ""Crowdlitoken""). More projects are expected in the future. This is where the present research project comes in. Project goals As part of the project, the possibilities of tokens in real estate investments are examined, approaches evaluated and implementation optimized. The basis for this is the first tokenization worldwide, the ""Hello World Project"", which was developed by Prof. Dr. Michael Trübestein MRICS was accompanied as well as the new legal framework since summer 2021. The topic ""Lex Koller"" will also be taken up and examined to what extent tokens (rights to rental income) are in line with current legislation and what implications this has for real estate investments. Furthermore, it is examined how the tradability of real estate tokens and token-based investment products is guaranteed (bankability). Concrete recommendations for action are highlighted based on various structures. Ideally, another pilot project will be implemented as part of a follow-up project with selected business partners. The project is breaking new scientific ground and the results cannot yet be precisely derived. Nevertheless, there is already a lot of experience in this area.

At the same time, the challenges in terms of returns and locations are increasing. Initial situation and scenario Logistics real estate and light industrial buildings have developed from a niche market into an asset class of their own and are certainly among the ""winners"" of recent years. This can be attributed to various factors: The new Silk Road, ""New Belt"", opens up new distribution channels, while at the same time Covid-19 accelerated online trade and thus also the demand for logistics space and consequently for logistics real estate. In this case, an additional 80,000 to 100,000 m2 of space is required for every CHF 1 billion in sales. However, good locations are becoming rarer and yields are falling, most recently (almost) to the level of investments in office properties. This is accompanied by an increasingly critical attitude towards logistics areas, ie the provision of compensation areas with a high level of biodiversity, the reduction of traffic in the cities and at logistics locations as well as increasingly important financial criteria on the part of the cities. Furthermore, new concepts, such as Cargo Sous Terrain, could change the general conditions for investments. As a result, opportunities change and require a targeted analysis. The type of logistics property must be taken into account here (big boxes vs. modular logistics). In addition to this, there is a strong interest in light industrial real estate: More and more companies are renting space in this area. This is where the present research project comes in and critically examines future investment opportunities at national and international level. Project goals Building on the current framework conditions described, the following project goals result: Market overview of investments in logistics real estate and development of the market as well as object structures (national and international) Empirical survey on investments in logistics real estate / light industrial at Swiss pension funds (in cooperation with the Swiss Pension Fund Association) : Preferences for investments and investment requirements, opportunities, market assessments, structures, volumes Specialist conference(s) with business partners Specialist publication(s) with business partners Review of the bundling of properties as part of the compensation areas / biodiversity (in cooperation with external partners)"," Steffen Daniel,  Casillo Lucas,  Aepli Matthias Daniel", Trübestein Michael

Initial situation: The Lucerne-Vierwaldstättersee adventure region with the Lucerne brand as a strong strategic basis, an established organization in the form of the system carrier Luzern Tourismus AG, its shareholders and network partners and a well-functioning cooperation model is fundamentally very successfully positioned. The destination has developed very well in recent years, which is reflected not only in a significant increase in overnight stays, but also in the BAK benchmark report, for example. Lucerne has been one of the top destinations for several years. Challenge: The development in the individual destinations of the heterogeneous Lucerne-Lake Lucerne Region has been very different in recent years. For example, while the city of Lucerne, Engelberg and Andermatt as well as the excursion mountains (eg Titlis, Pilatus, Rigi) have developed very positively, the development in the rural regions was significantly less dynamic. This difference is also reflected in the differentiation between the large and strong tourism organizations and the smaller cantonal and regional tourism organizations. The largest and most important tourism organization is Luzern Tourismus AG (LTAG). It is the lead organization in Central Switzerland and takes on important central tasks in the area of national and, above all, international marketing and, increasingly, in relation to strategic product development. The cantonal and regional tourism organizations are often too small to be able to take on important tasks in product development and marketing themselves. There are also other challenges such as digitization and social, economic and ecological changes. Goals: Based on the challenges outlined, the following goals are being pursued in the project: Vision & Strategy: Development of a common Vision 2030 and Strategy 2025, including the definition of common key issues for the Lucerne-Lake Lucerne Region, taking trends and opportunities for differentiation into account. System development - Evolution & Innovation: Analysis of the tourism system with the 5 cantons with a focus on the roles of the tourism organizations and the most important service partners. Lighthouse projects: Development and marketing of joint lighthouse projects, including the involvement of service partners in NRP projects Implementation: through support and individual coaching."," Steffen Angela,  Eggli Florian,  Fickel Lisa,  Wyss Lucienne,  Huck Lukas,  Zimmermann Luzia,  Meier-Crameri Ursina", Stettler Jürg

Collection of quantitative and qualitative data on users of public spaces, their perception and forms of appropriation. Initial situation: The design of public urban spaces is of great interest to the population of the city of Zurich. The planning and development of such spaces are anchored in the city administration of Zurich as strategic fixed points with high priority. As part of the evaluation of the urban planning and implementation processes, questions arise about different forms of appropriation and use as well as about the perception of the spaces by the different users and ultimately about specific requests for improvement. On the other hand, it is of interest to what extent complex and dynamic processes that characterize the various urban spaces play an essential role in the formation of identity and quality of life. These questions also present the civil engineering department of the city of Zurich with a variety of challenges and require continuous evaluation of its work. The investigation is theoretically located in a socio-spatial approach. Spaces are understood as social spaces, as a product of societal processes, whereby public spaces are considered in particular to be indicators of the integrative power and diversity of cities. These theoretical considerations form the basis for the stringent research design. Objectives Annual examination of three selected public spaces for 5 years Collection of representative findings on room users and satisfaction with the quality of stay through counts and standardized surveys Analysis of room qualities, various forms of use and appropriation, atmospheres and dynamic processes as well as function and design through qualitative approaches such as participating observations. Differentiated examination of the complex facets of public spaces through an in-depth analysis of one space per year, using workshops with different groups of actors in which the focus is on the process of planning and design, as well as commented perception walks with selected users Implementation and results In the In the first three years of the study, nine public spaces in the city of Zurich were examined: sections of Seefeldstrasse, Hardstrasse and Schaffhauserstrasse, the Affoltern and Stettbach train stations, the Lettenviaduct, the squares of Brupbacher- and Anny-Klawa-Platz, which were redesigned as part of the flanking measures for the western bypass, and the Sechseläutenplatz. The latter three were subjected to an in-depth analysis. In general, it can be pointed out that satisfaction with the public spaces examined is very high and that the function, design and use of the spaces are in balance. Completely redesigned rooms need some time for forms of appropriation to manifest themselves. Each year of investigation ends with a report. All reports are publicly available on the TAZ homepage."," Nägeli Bettina,  Müller Meike,  Litscher Monika,  Fux Sarah,  Gäumann Simone", Emmenegger Barbara

Background: In everyday life we assume that there is a connection between a person's verbal behavior and their personality. So far, however, this connection has not been examined by either linguistics or psychology. In linguistics, the personality of the speaker is largely taboo. There is evidence from psychology that introverts and extraverts differ in their verbal behavior. Aim: The aim of the interdisciplinary project applied for here is to examine whether a correlation between the interaction profile of people and their personality can be determined and whether this correlation can be proven with a combination of linguistic conversation analysis and psychological personality test. Procedure: Test persons should solve a task in groups and complete a personality test individually. The conversations are transcribed and annotated. All lines of conversation are recorded and condensed into individual interaction profiles. It is then statistically checked whether there are correlations between the interaction profiles of the subjects and the dimensions of their personality. Benefit: The pilot project is intended to clarify whether the assumed connection between verbal behavior and personality exists. This would close a major research gap in both linguistics and psychology."," Valero Domingo,  Moist Richard", Bendel Larcher Sylvia

For this reason, lighting is repeatedly mentioned in the current energy discussion as a central element in measures to increase efficiency. In Switzerland, offices are very often equipped with floor lamps. Today's floor lamps mainly use LEDs to generate light and are equipped with a sensor system that detects both presence and the distribution of brightness below the floor lamp. These two measures make it possible to implement needs-based lighting at the workplaces, which can reduce energy consumption to a minimum. These measures are also laid down or required in the energy ordinances (MuKN) and the valid standards (SIA380/4, 2006) of Switzerland. However, the current market situation shows that the performance data at full load are used when comparing luminaire specifications. The quality of the sensors used (daylight and presence) and the control algorithms used are not taken into account here. Since this is already integrated in floor lamps, the sensors should be an important quality criterion when making your selection. In practice, this criterion can hardly be taken into account by planners and builders. The sensors are also required within the standards and energy label (Minergie label light), but their quality is not described in more detail. Due to the lack of specifications, there is no incentive for companies to develop a sensor system that enables maximum energy efficiency. The feasibility study aims to develop a test procedure. The results of the test should make it possible to evaluate floor lamps (including sensors for detecting extraneous light) with regard to their efficiency in partial load operation. The overarching goal of the feasibility study is to actively support the energy goals of the federal government and to promote the development of innovative products in the field of energy efficiency in Switzerland. The results serve to educate/sensitize decision-makers and public authorities. In addition, the findings in the area of standardization and labeling (MinergieLabel light, SIA 387/4) are to be fed in."," Dahinden Christoph,  Gerber Silas", Schrader Björn

Changes due to the energy measures required today mostly generate severe restrictions, Architectural monuments have a material and a symbolic value. Changes due to the energy measures required today mostly generate severe limitations, since they impair the historical surfaces or add incompatible design elements. A large number of monuments are built in a way that is energy-efficient and it is often only when they are used that they require energy optimization. One possibility for renewal and optimization is the constructive stripping of the facade from the inside. This approach is particularly suitable for buildings whose interior is less worthy of protection because of its surfaces and more because of its formal design. High requirements are divided into several low-technical layers. The existing facade remains as untouched as possible and/or is merely restored. A second shell is arranged on the inside, which ensures today's energetic, acoustic and fire protection requirements. The space between the facade and the newly applied layer can vary in depth. Depending on the object and depending on the use, certain room and construction concepts are suitable for meeting the energy requirements. In this way, the old and the new layer can be joined together directly (strategy 1, the case) or an intermediate space can be generated for guiding technical installations and for insulation (strategy 2, the sequence of layers). If, on the other hand, the old shell and the inner new layer form a usable space in between, we speak of the house-in-house type (strategy 3).

Against this background, old people's and care institutions are also required to react to the changing demand with an appropriate offer. The project, financed by the Lucerne School of Social Work, explored the extent to which socio-cultural animation could supplement the range of established professions in institutions, such as therapeutic professions. Related to this was the question of how specific socio-cultural skills and methods could be designed in a future field of work ""retirement and nursing homes for very old people"". The research results were published in a short report. The report contains answers to the following questions: - What are the challenges for socio-cultural animation in old people's and nursing homes? – Which offers and methodological approaches are conceivable for socio-cultural animation in old people's and nursing homes? – What are the conclusions for practice, in education and training and for research?"," Nägeli Bettina,  Jung Jasmin,  Aeschlimann Lea,  Meyer Simone,  Kirchschlager Stephan"," Friz Annina,  Hangartner Gabriele"

This corresponds to an energy requirement of 40 GWh per year. This research project is looking for ways to make SBB point heating systems more energy-efficient. When trains are delayed, rail customers quickly become indignant. A prerequisite for punctuality is the good condition of the rail material. This also includes the flawless functioning of the points. If covered with ice or snow, the turnout function can be impaired or fail completely. In order to avoid points failure due to ice or snow, the points are heated when the weather conditions are appropriate. On the other hand, excessive heating can lead to switch failures and increases the energy requirement. The operational safety of the points is the top priority. The optimal balance between guaranteed point function and economical point heating is in demand. In order to realize a useful and at the same time economical heating, the efficiency and the dynamics of a point heating must be understood. For this purpose, the switch is modeled with a heating element, gravel and side wind.

In order to start the interior work, the construction must first be dried. When erecting new buildings, for example when applying interior plaster or subfloor, large amounts of water are processed. Only after the building has dried can the interior work begin. Since natural drying would usually take too much time and this interruption of the construction phase would be too expensive, the drying process is accelerated by construction dryers. Depending on the size, different systems are used. In smaller buildings, electrically operated air dryers are usually used, which circulate the air inside the building and dry it in the process. In large buildings, heated outside air is often fed into the building, which then exits the building again after absorbing moisture. The energy for heating the air is provided electrically or by oil burners. Building drying is very energy-intensive. For this reason, the heat is now to be provided by means of a mobile air/air or air/water heat pump. By using a heat pump, the energy supplied can be greatly reduced with the same heat output, which reduces the operating costs by a factor of the coefficient of performance (COP). The air/air heat pump should only be used as a dehumidifier, with the evaporator and condenser being operated in the same place. With the air/water heat pump, the evaporator and condenser are placed outside, with the condenser dissipating the heat to a water-glycol circuit. This water-glycol circuit feeds decentralized heat exchangers with fans, which are set up in different rooms in the building. In this way, the thermal energy is fed into the building via the heated water-glycol mixture and released again in the decentralized convectors. Since the pump output is only a negligibly small fraction of the fan output, considerable electrical energy can be saved compared to heating the building without a decentralized heat exchanger. This heat pump can also be used for cooling and dehumidification. For cooling, the evaporator is set up inside, the heat from the condenser is released to the environment via a dry cooler or the decentralized convectors. If the building is to be dehumidified without overheating, evaporators and convectors are operated in the building."," Wellig Beat,  Gasser Lukas,  Tresch Sergio,  Flück Stefan,  Krimmel Stefan,  Käch Tobias,  Birrer Werner", Kleingries Mirko

In building thermography, the colors of the thermal images are often used to make individual estimates of the heat losses from components and thermal bridges. In order for such interpretations to be comprehensible, the thermograms should be presented in a standardized way. This can be achieved with the QualiThermo method. This procedure was created on a purely empirical basis and provides specifications for the color wedge scaling. This makes it possible, to a limited extent, to display thermal images equally, even if different meteorological conditions prevailed during the recordings. The aim of this SFOE project was to review and further develop the QualiThermo method. For this purpose, a test building was thermally measured in detail during the 2009/2010 winter season and observed in sections with two IR cameras. With simulation calculations and subsequent sensitivity analyses, it was then possible to show which meteorological factors are decisive for the accuracy of the heat loss estimate.

Furthermore, the particle concentration in the room air must not exceed certain limit values due to the minerals introduced. The physical processes involved in the atomization of the water and subsequent evaporation are being investigated theoretically and experimentally using LDA/PDA laser measurement technology. The simulations and observations show that the droplets evaporate completely within a sufficiently short distance. Humidification with raw water is technically possible and the increase in particle number and mass concentration in the room air is within the tolerable range.

In order to come to broadly based solutions, all those involved must be given the opportunity to actively participate in such planning and thus make the process as democratic as possible. This is currently happening primarily with plans, models and texts, which are often difficult for laypersons to understand and comprehend. These hurdles make communication and information transfer at eye level more difficult. The combination of augmented reality with smartphones and tablets opens up promising new design and application options in urban planning and development: AR visualizations have the potential, on the one hand, to close the abstraction gap between planning (plans, visualizations, diagrams) and realization (space, Material, function) to close clearly. On the other hand, the clear presentation of complex planning and participation processes can encourage active participation, especially among younger people.

The structural change in the direction of the knowledge economy is an important driver of spatial development. The question arises as to whether and how the recent financial crisis influenced or still influences spatial development in Germany and Switzerland through the reconfiguration of the location networks of the knowledge economy. Has the structural change in the direction of the knowledge economy and the increasing globalization of value chains, accelerated by the global financial and economic crisis, led to a re-concentration of entrepreneurial activities in metropolitan regions? Or does this process lead to a de-concentration and relocation of entrepreneurial activities to peripheral regions in order to save costs and build up new knowledge bases and value chains? The main goal of the research project is to examine the dynamics of the functional spatial hierarchy in Germany and Switzerland in the context of the recent financial and economic crisis. It is about understanding globalization and its consequences for the dynamics of spatial development with a view to the knowledge economy. The main ambition of the research project can be summarized as follows: (1) identification of similarities and differences in the development of connectivity and functional-spatial hierarchy in Germany and Switzerland in the wake of the recent financial and economic crisis; (2) Improving the understanding of globalization as a key factor for changing the spatial organization of entrepreneurial value chains and its consequences for the city systems in Germany and Switzerland; (3) providing evidence for the interdependence between physical accessibility and non-physical connectivity and between flows and stocks in the knowledge economy; (4) Mapping and visualization of the dynamics of connectivity and functional spatial hierarchy in the German and Swiss urban system; (5) Development of a long-term panel survey to investigate functional-spatial connectivity in Germany and Switzerland; (6) Development of a series of alternative, evidence-based spatial perspectives as a basis for future spatial development strategies in Germany and Switzerland."," Magnin Chantal,  Willimann Ivo,  von dem Berge Karina,  Ottiger Kathrin,  Zöllner Silke", Lüthi Stefan

Amand Vanderhagen is best known today for his teaching works for flute (Méthode nouvelle et raisonnée pour la flûte, Paris,1790 / Nouvelle méthode de flûte, Paris,1799), oboe (Méthode nouvelle et raisonnée pour le hautbois, 1792) and clarinet ( Method nouvelle et raisonnée pour la clarinette, Paris, 1785 and 1799; Nouvelle method pour la clarinette modern à 12 clés, Paris, 1819). Of his numerous arrangements and compositions, only six works are currently available in practical editions. In addition to an annotated translation of the ""Méthode nouvelle et raisonnée pour la clarinette, Paris, 1785"", a selection of three works was made from the first editions and copies listed in numerous libraries in Europe and North America, in order to prepare them as a practical new edition for lessons and concerts. The following works for larger wind instruments (2 fl/picc, 2 cl, 2 cor, 2 fag) from the stock of the Bibliothèque de Genève were transcribed from microfilm and supplemented with a double bass part: Morceaux choisis dans les œuvres du célèbre Haydn, Ouverture de Don Juan ( trompette et trombonne ad libitum), Airs du Mariage de Figaro (deuxième livraison). In a text-critical comparison of the ""Airs"" with the original text of Mozart's ""Le nozze di Figaro"" (New Mozart Edition), numerous differences were found with regard to the articulations and dynamic expression markings and marked in color in the reconstructed score. An accompanying text points out many parallels between Vanderhagen's ""Méthode"" and Leopold Mozart's ""Attempt at a Thorough Violin School"". In addition, the instrumental parts were accompanied by the libretto text, which contains essential information about the emotional content of the music. On the basis of these points of reference for the instrumental performance of a vocal part and with the practical performance tips from both educational works, the musicians can develop an independent, differentiated and historically informed approach to interpreting the music of the late 18th century.", Camp Marc-Antoine, Mätzener Heinrich

Stressful background noise and noise, inadequate lighting conditions and a lack of visual stimulation promote the development of fears, stress and delirium. In hospitals and care institutions, the ceiling has so far been understood as a functional room element with little design and therapeutic potential. As part of the CeilHeal research project, a ceiling is being developed as a system product consisting of three validated modules: acoustics, biodynamic and atmospheric light with individual control and visual design motifs. This interdisciplinary further development of a blanket opens up an innovative, therapeutic spectrum of effects for the hospital and care sector and closes a research-based gap. In addition, interfaces in the areas of acoustics, lighting, electrical and building services planning are solved, which guarantee a more efficient process in planning and construction, and research-based, holistic consulting and planning materials are created for different stakeholders. CeilHeal is being developed by the main implementation partner, Cridea Acoustics AG, together with Moos Licht AG and Hefti.Hess.Martignoni AG.

The process enables the energy-efficient production of renewable LNG. Biomethane is a high-quality renewable energy source and has almost the same properties as natural gas. Biomethane is mainly obtained from biogas by separating secondary components. For the transport of the gas to the end user, however, biogas processing plants are tied to an available connection to the natural gas network. In order to enable the production of biomethane in off-grid regions, the CC TEVT has developed the three-phase process for upgrading and liquefying biogas. Liquid biomethane (LBM, bio-LNG) has an energy density 600 times higher than methane under atmospheric conditions and can be transported by tank truck. The main step in biogas processing is the separation of CO2. In the Three Phase Process, CO2 is desublimated (direct solidification from the gas phase). The solid CO2 (dry ice) is used to cool the biogas and is melted in the process. This significantly reduces the energy requirement of the process. The high-purity liquid CO2 is used for pre-cooling or can be marketed in the form of dry ice pellets as a high-value by-product.

In addition, this question is supplemented by the media dimension. So far, the focus in the collaboration of locally distributed teams has mostly been on a purely technologically inspired (""technology-driven"") solution. The surrounding physical space is often hidden. Accordingly, the “RÄMSKI” project goes one step further and tries to discuss what integral media could look like. The question is therefore: “What is the right mix/blend between spatial, content-related and media aspects when collaborating?” Based on an online analysis with potential users, the basis for a prototypical ""spatial-medial setting"" is determined and implemented in a mockup. This is then experimentally examined and evaluated. The aim of this experiment is to develop a criteria grid with the most important influencing factors in the areas of space and media, in order to be able to design media-enhanced spaces for collaboration in innovation processes in the future."," Koller Fabienne,  Meissner Jens O.,  Fraefel Stefan", Eckert Jan

So far, each protective device has been individually fitted to the head with gauze, bandages and layers of plastic foam. The foam is attached to the highly sensitive areas (eyes) and hoses/cables are secured with adhesive strips. The creation is very time consuming. There is currently no generalized protective device on the market that can be quickly attached in the OR and individually adapted to the head. There is also no solution that is permeable to air and at the same time antibacterial. The preliminary study should show to what extent such a protective device must be worked out so that it can be used in practice.

(Wedge 1987:277) Charles Keil's hypothesis that the quality of a 'swinging' jazz performance is revealed on the microrhythmic level is now widely accepted in the research community. In the past 20 years, several attempts have been made to unravel the mystery of these 'little discrepancies'. The analyzes by Reinholdsson 1987, Rose 1989, Ellis 1991, Huang/Huang 1994, Prögler 1995, Collier/Collier 1996, Ashley 1996, Järvinen 1997, Ashley 2002, Busse 2002, Friberg/Sundström 2002, Collier/Collier 2002, Iyer 200 2, Pressing 2002, Senn 2005, Benadon 2006 describe the rhythmic relations of selected examples mostly in a precise way and give numerous insights into the rhythmic formation within jazz ensembles. However, no generalizable theory of swing can be derived from the previous analyzes. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that the analyzes proceed very differently in terms of methodology. On the other hand, the analyzes suggest that ""swing"" is actually not a generalizable microrhythmic phenomenon, but also presents itself differently in different contexts. The methodological disparity of the investigations does not allow a conclusive assessment here. The previous discussion produces interesting empirical results, but it is extremely poor in theoretical reflection: the analysis methods are usually only described in a very rudimentary way, the visualization presents the analysis results in a mostly uninformative way; a theory of the rhythmic interaction is hitherto unknown. This project is developing two contributions for a conference in London and a series of lectures in Zurich. These contributions design a rudimentary theory of rhythmic interaction, develop criteria and an algorithm for measuring microrhythmic properties, analyze microrhythmics with this method using one example each, and visualize the analysis results with LARA. Based on the patterns recognizable in the LARA diagrams, cautious hypotheses can be formulated as to which rhythmic properties make the examples ""swing"".", Senn Olivier, Kilchenmann Lorenz

The output consists of the upper body of the paraplegic patient being filmed and positioned on strange, walking legs of a background video in such a way that the patient has the illusion that everything is fine and that he can walk.

Circular economy models deliver business benefits in profitability and efficiency, as well as improving climate impact. In practice, their adoption is limited by a lack of skills, knowledge and awareness among practitioners to change current practices, and challenge existing business models. The transition to a circular economy will require a systemic change, encompassing multiple partners involved in the design, development and delivery of projects.In order to foster the innovative thinking of different type of learners which will drive systemic change, we will use a case-based teaching approach combined with storytelling training power, by developing a set of video case studies on circular business models and strategies. The video cases will reflect the complexity of the whole (circular) value chain, including different stakeholders. By showcasing examples of circular business model choices and transitions, and analyzing the decisions regarding strategies that are implemented in real-life cases, we aim to inspire entrepreneurship students, early stage and experienced entrepreneurs and SMEs. It will provide them the knowledge, awareness and, through interactive sessions, they learn the skills to analyze cases, build on best practices, and use tools to more quickly validate assumptions of possible business model opportunities in the field of circular entrepreneurship. The living business cases will be integrated in already existing Circular Economy education formats and tested in close coordination with Climate-KIC pilot experiences.

The aim of such investments is above all to secure innovation and strategic options for the future for the established company and to secure resources (finance, personnel, know-how) for the pioneer company. A typical example of corporate venturing is Nestlé's Nespresso venture (Nespresso was attached directly to CEO Helmut Maucher as a unit so as not to get lost in the Nestlé organization's shelf-metre thinking). This project addresses the following points: TP1) corporate venturing as a strategic alternative in business development from a single-company perspective, TP2) corporate venturing activities in Switzerland from a supra-company perspective, and TP3) the role of corporate venturing in the market for venture capital and private individuals Equity from the point of view of the investors. Thus, at the end of the project, there is a map of the corporate venturing activities and statements about what makes them successful. In addition, it is examined whether corporate venturing could play a role in the private equity market.",, Wunderlin Christian

So-called coworking spaces have settled in rural areas in Switzerland in recent years. Examples include Laax, Davos, Scuol, Samedan and the Bernese Oberland. Coworking spaces are office space that can be used temporarily, which freelancers, creative people, start-up founders and employees with flexible work arrangements in terms of time and space can use. The aim of the research project is to explore the transformation of work through digitization against the background of coworking spaces in rural areas. The main focus is on the following research questions: (1) What characterizes the lifestyle of mobile workers in coworking spaces? (2) How do users practice ""place-making"" to create a sense of a coworking community? (3) What impact do coworking spaces have on the local economy? (4) Do coworking spaces have the potential to reduce urban-rural disparities? As a result of the project, the research results flow into discussions of spatial and transport policy. In cooperation with VillageOffice, Mia Engiadina and the Swiss Federal Office for Spatial Development ARE, four case studies from Laax and Davos (rural) as well as from Bern and Zurich (urban) are used and examined against the background of the research questions.

Critical review of performance is today one of the most common professional and commercial forms of music written response. Despite the availability of representative material and its impact on musicians’ careers, there has been little structured enquiry into the way music critics make sense of their experience of performances, and no studies have to date broached the key question of how music performance is reviewed by experts. Adopting an explorative, inductive approach and a novel combination of data reduction and thematic analysis techniques, this research presents a systematic investigation of a vast corpus of recorded performance critical reviews. First, reviews of Beethoven’s piano sonata recordings (N = 845) published in the Gramophone (1923-2010) were collected and metadata and word-stem patterns were analysed to offer insights on repertoire, pianists and critics involved and to produce a representative selection (n = 100) of reviews suitable for subsequent thematic analysis. Inductive thematic analyses, including a key-word-in-context analysis on ‘expression’, were then used to identify performance features (primary and supervenient) and extra-performance elements critics discuss, as well as reasons they use to support their value judgements. This led to a novel descriptive model of critical review of recorded performance. The model captures four critical activities – evaluation, descriptive judgement, factual information and meta-criticism – and seven basic evaluation criteria on the aesthetic and achievement-related value of performance reliably used by critics, plus two recording-specific criteria: live-performance impact and collectability. Critical review emerges as a highly dense form of writing, rich in information and open to diverse analytical approaches. Insights gained throughout the thesis inform current discourses in philosophy of art and open new perspectives for empirical music research. They emphasise the importance of the comparative element in performance evaluation, the complexity and potentially misleading nature of the notion of ‘expression’ in the musical discourse, and the role of critics as filters of choice in the recording market. Foremost, they further our understanding of the nature of music performance criticism as a form of reasoned evaluation that is complex, contextual and listener specific.", Carreras Sandoval Victoria Jane," Alessandri Elena,  Senn Olivier"

Cyber security is a very dynamic topic. Almost every day, the media reports about new vulnerabilities and types of attacks, which are immediately exploited by attackers. This large volume and the fast pace makes it difficult for lecturers to recognize the relevance of current reports and to decide which ones should be processed for teaching. In particular, the question arises as to whether a new type of attack concept was used, the basics of which should be brought closer to the students in class, or whether it is ""only"" the exploitation of a programming error. A similar problem regarding detection also affects students at your future job in the field of cyber security, both in the field of attacks (penetration tester) and in the field of defense (cyber security specialist).

Content and goal We will develop an ICT infrastructure that provides a suitable ecosystem for future-oriented financial simulation and analysis. In addition, we will further develop the financial-mathematical tools for risk analysis. Key elements of our technology are: (i) the ACTUS standard for the digital representation of financial contracts; (ii) blockchain technology and smart contracts for decentralized finance; (iii) big data technology; (iv) State-of-the-art financial analysis. This infrastructure enables a largely automated, situation-dependent risk assessment of individual financial institutions (microprudential supervision) and in the final stage of the entire financial system (macroprudential supervision). Scientific and social context Effective and efficient financial regulation serves to stabilize the financial system and thus the entire economy and society. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 showed this impressively. Regulatory financial reporting is a key element. With the new infrastructure, regulatory financial reports can be flexibly adapted to the respective needs and created quickly.

The adaptive solutions are of particular importance here, as they can react dynamically to changing light or solar radiation. The complex mechanics and drive technology of adaptive systems often lead to high maintenance and repair costs and require additional control measures during operation. In addition, the ""shading"" and ""exposure"" functions are divided into two levels that work more or less independently of one another, the material level and the mechanical system level. The concept idea is based on developing a smart functional textile with adaptive light transmission, with a focus on greatly reduced or eliminated mechanics and wearing parts. The textile should meet the requirements for sun protection or glare protection, while the light transmission can be controlled dynamically by changing the pattern and/or shape of the textile part.

With the preliminary study ""Good quality in building technology, a matter of course"", around 4,000 questionnaires were sent out with the aim of obtaining a picture of the quality in building technology. The survey also showed where deficiencies can occur. The insights gained are now being implemented in this study, and 40 case studies are being worked out.

In it, possibilities are explored of how color can be applied using tool attachments on the extrusion press, relief structures can be transferred and the surface of ceramic stones can be specifically manipulated by designers during ongoing production. The research aims to develop a small system of combinable tools that lead to a large number of creative and functional product variants and flexible production options. The cultivation of the creative influence of architects and planners in the partially open production processes opens up a new market. The variety of the offer but also the associated diversity of the solutions is demanded and expanded. An attachment with a color insert is planned, which can generate color variations on the surface and new, specific types of color in a material-efficient way. In addition, an attachment is to be designed which, in contrast to previously rigid extrusion tools, can change its surface structure during ongoing production. The tool attachments should lead to the great design potential and the desired freedom of design, both individually and in the overlapping of the themes of color and structure. The tools, which can be used individually or in combination, are aimed at flexible, dynamic and efficient changes in design, even for small series. In the project, the results from the experiments are validated with user-centered methods: The system boundaries and requirements from the user's point of view (design process / design) are identified."," Gassler Cornelia,  Geissbühler Dieter,  De Angelis Marco,  Thalmann Markus,  Huwiler Martin,  Pflugshaupt Ruedi,  Gerig Simon,  Triller Susanne", Müggler Zumstein Isabel Rosa

Based on gaming behavior data from customers of an online casino, a prediction model is being developed that allows risky gaming behavior to be identified at an early stage. The advent of online gambling and the ability to gamble via mobile devices has fundamentally changed the gambling landscape over the past two decades. From the public health perspective, the easier availability of the games, the immediacy and the lack of social control are critically assessed in connection with online gambling. Overall, however, online gambling also offers opportunities for effective player protection. Every player has a user account. Using the ""Behavioural Tracking"" method, those responsible for player protection in online casinos can identify risky gaming behavior of their customers at an early stage and react to it. On the basis of ""behavioural tracking"", a prediction model is being developed as part of the envisaged research project, which will enable early detection of risky behavior on the part of customers of online gambling providers. The focus is on the sensitivity and precision of the prediction model, ie the model should ensure that in the course of early detection only those players are recorded who actually play risky games. The research design consists of several complementary strands of methods, some of which are cyclical. This includes various data science methods such as data mining, machine learning and data analytical modelling, which are based on abductive, inductive and deductive approaches. There are also visual analytics techniques. A comprehensive data set provided by the implementation partner, Grand Casino Luzern, serves as the basis. As part of an exploratory data analysis, features are identified that indicate risky gaming behavior. Patterns of gaming behavior are also revealed by means of visualization, which experience has shown to be problematic (e.g. “chasing” or “chasing” losses). In several cycles, the identified early detection criteria and additional parameters are tested directly in the existing data using data mining and machine learning. At the same time, models are generated and optimized. The hypotheses derived from this are modeled and validated using data analysis. Visual analytics facilitates the traceability of the models and contributes to their optimization. The federal law on gambling stipulates that the organizers of online games of chance must set criteria within the framework of early detection that can be used to identify at-risk players at an early stage. The research project thus contributes to the effective protection of players."," Dollfus Christian,  Lehmann Elina,  Stechschulte Gabriel,  Janetzko Halldór,  Schwarz Jürg,  Kaufmann Michael,  Meschenmoser Philipp", Lischer Suzanne

In contrast to previous typologies, the use of the locations became a key feature. The building and transport department of the canton of Basel-Stadt commissioned the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to catalog the use of public space in the city of Basel. The following points of public space were of particular interest: Places (squares/streets) Area (expansion: square or street) Freely usable area Periphery development Ground floor uses Furnishing Location and accessibility Uses What is already happening today in terms of uses requiring a permit and spontaneous appropriations Users (Who uses the room?) The uses often change in a relatively short time over the course of the day. The complex interaction between space appropriation, design and the management of public spaces pointed out that uniform approaches in dealing with challenges in public urban spaces had to be critically questioned. Rather, it was necessary to examine local peculiarities and act in a location-specific manner. A typology of the use of urban spaces therefore ran the risk of not doing justice to this complexity. Nevertheless, a categorization depending on the application could be helpful. The focus was on the “distribution” of uses and functions across the city. The survey was based on the following objectives: The relevant uses of public spaces over the course of the day were to be recorded. A first proposal for a categorization of the examined spaces should create the basis for the discussion about a usage typology of the public space. A use-oriented categorization should make it easier to identify potential conflicting goals and to allocate tasks to public spaces in the context of the entire urban space. When recording usage, an attempt was made to record the most important types of public spaces using particularly typical locations. The use was observed on a warm and dry summer day with several surveys during the course of the day. In order to be able to collect the large number of locations as quickly as possible, a uniform recording grid was used with several recording persons. The large number of characteristics recorded were grouped into categories based on the survey results.",, Steiner Thomas

On the one hand by predicting the weather-dependent electricity production using machine learning algorithms and on the other hand by changing the behavior of electricity consumption. The need for sustainable living situations in Switzerland is growing. This is reflected in the increasing demand for energy-efficient living space with its own renewable energy production. The growing number of solar systems on house roofs also testifies to the awareness of ecological sustainability. However, solar systems can only rarely be operated cost-effectively. One of the main reasons is the low feed-in tariff in the public electricity grid, which has been around 8 centimes/kWh since access to cost-covering feed-in tariffs (KEV) was practically impossible. The profitability of a solar system can be increased by consuming as much electricity as possible on site and thus not having to sell it to the grid (optimization of self-consumption). In order to optimize self-consumption, it is essential to have a reliable forecast of the weather-dependent solar power production on the one hand and consumption by the consumer to be adapted to the power production on the other. However, the latter requires a change in behavior in terms of electricity consumption in the self-consumption community. On the one hand, this project is intended to examine what a prediction model (machine learning algorithm) for the yield of a solar system in Switzerland for self-consumption optimization looks like, which is based on publicly accessible measurement data and thus causes no further costs. On the other hand, it should be examined which possibilities can be created for a change in consumer behavior to optimize self-consumption, which can be independently adapted to individual needs and are not perceived as paternalistic."," Waldis Andreas,  Näther Caroline,  Minonne Clemente,  Schumacher Felix"," Korner Leonz,  Minonne Clemente"

From the artist's perspective, it asks about possibilities of access to religion that belong neither to politics nor to the church and also do not simply lead into the private esoteric. The thesis is that art offers an open and initially neutral field for dealing with religious iconography and traditions. In doing so, it is doing important mediating work for the current social change in relation to religion and faith. The project assumes that the religious has acquired a new meaning on the level of the individual as well as within the secular society in recent decades, which also new confrontations within contemporary art with questions of religion. Whether in the metaphysics of Bill Viola's work or in James Turrell's light installations: art and the art world are in an active and newly strengthened dialogue with religious questions.

The aim of the ""low-threshold access to music lessons"" development project was to encourage socio-economically disadvantaged young people in secondary school to make their own music and attend music lessons regularly in a two-semester program. Workshops on various pop music topics were followed by a band workshop, which culminated in a performance at the local music festival. The accompanying research by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts linked to the project asked about the specifics of the mediation processes as well as about the conditions for success and included interviews with the young people involved, the project manager, the stakeholders and observations during the workshops. The importance of learning with and from peers became apparent. In terms of motivation, it is not so much the repertoire played that seems decisive, but rather the aspect of ""authenticity"", i.e. the integration into a ""scene"", for which the performance at the local talent festival was the initiation. Some young people found the lack of commitment from their peers and the different requirements discouraging, which the workshops were able to compensate for to some extent. The research at the interface between the youth culture center and the music school also showed that the thresholds were less of an external nature, but rather based on the respective self-image of the institutions. While the musical activity in the youth center belongs more to the area of ""community music"", where the integrative element is of great importance and the musical quality is secondary, the music school sees itself as an educational institution in which formal learning with appropriate practice is the focus. As a consequence, it is advisable for music schools to be open to new forms of teaching, repertoires and institutional partners. For youth centers, on the other hand, it remains to be considered how they can benefit from the commitment and quality awareness of the music schools.

There is also a desire to further differentiate and modularly design the offer for the special needs of integrative or separate schools. Topics could be, for example: ""body knowledge"", ""relationship, intimacy and privacy"", ""prevention and protection against sexually transmitted infections"", and ""protection against sexual assault"". Such a structure would also meet the needs of curative education teachers and specialists. They also want further training on sex education topics, which is why it is advisable to expand the target group of the offer accordingly and offer specific further training on relationship and sexuality-related topics at multiplier level. This would allow topics that are considered particularly important in everyday school life, such as “setting boundaries”, “protection against sexual violence” or “dealing with media and social media”, to be taken up and deepened in order to strengthen the teachers and specialists in their ability to act with confidence.

The research project asks about the design, distribution and conditions of employment organized or prescribed by social welfare. The legal analysis includes a development of the constitutional and international legal framework, an inventory and analysis of the complex legal bases in the individual cantons (social welfare law is largely cantonal) and an evaluation of the socio-scientific investigations of the situation in selected cantons that are also planned in the project. The project results bring legal clarification and the basis for legal policy decisions. In the event of longer periods of unemployment, after social security, social assistance offers a minimum income as the last safety net. However, due to the change to an activating welfare state, this is increasingly linked to participation in employment programs or work assignments. But what exactly happens legally? Under what legal conditions do work assignments take place within the framework of social assistance, what consequences does this have for other legal relationships and how widespread are the different configurations? The project therefore asks first about the constitutional and labor law framework conditions of employment relationships under social welfare law, secondly about their specific legal structure and the heterogeneity of the same, thirdly about their actual spread in legal practice and their possible socio-political functions (qualification, integration, disciplining, legitimacy) as well as after legal need for action and, fourthly, it examines and develops adequate supplementary regulations. The project relies on legal dogmatic clarifications as well as legal and social scientific research into legal facts (case law, legal mobilization, actual dissemination) and a legal and political scientific contextualization of the results. The project closes a gap in the legal doctrine for the regulation of labor and employment relationships in the first, second and third labor market. For legal practice, the results offer orientation in questions of interpretation. Facts on social welfare employment relationships are provided for politicians and specific need for action is identified."," Canonica Alan,  Mühlebach Christine,  Da Rui Gena,  Müller Marianne,  Abbas Marina,  Näpfli Keller Nadine", Fuchs Gesine

In a first step of the investigation, a total of 12 employees of the social concept department and the management of three online gambling providers were asked in the context of semi-structural interviews which indicators could be used to assess a customer's gaming behavior as problematic. In a second step, the generated indicators were empirically evaluated. In a double-blind process, the e-mail communication of 150 customers who closed their gaming account and the customer communication of an equally large control group were evaluated. The comparison between the experimental and the control group revealed a significant difference in terms of the number of emails. The results also showed that it is not DSM-IV-relevant criteria that provide information about problematic gaming behavior in the test group, but rather indicators such as game evaluation, financial transactions or account administration.

A location analysis and a marketing concept have already been developed. From the point of view of business Uri and the Central Switzerland Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHZ), the question now arises as to whether business can launch an NRP project together with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to promote area development. The goal of Wirtschaft Uri is the realization of an ""Innovation Park Uri"". The principle is: The needs and activities of the companies define the content of the area development, and this in turn defines the marketing concept (not the other way round). Those responsible in the Canton of Uri are generally positive about the idea of an ""Uri Innovation Park"", but expect a corresponding initiative from the private sector. At this point in time, it seems sensible to initiate a process for the development of the “Altdorf Cantonal Station” area that bundles the needs of the various stakeholders (owners, local and future companies, universities, public authorities, etc.). If you want to be successful later in settling companies, they must be involved in the development as early as possible. Settlement and area development go hand in hand. The marketing concept is developed iteratively in this process, in the sense of a target image for the “Uri Innovation Park”. The target image corresponds to a narrative positioning idea and should not be fixed, but should be able to adapt and trigger dynamics in the planning process. Openness of use in planning is important in order to be able to adapt as flexibly as possible to the changing requirements of the various users and companies without losing sight of the qualities of the location.

Recommendations for change are derived from the experiences of communities that have introduced a new community leadership model (usually to the CEO model). The community governance model defines the function of the ward council and the members of the ward council, and the manner in which government is run. The choice of church leadership model is an important decision in the church development process. The new municipal law of the Canton of Lucerne (effective from 2005) strengthened the autonomy of the municipalities. They were given the opportunity to reorganize their community and adopt a leadership model that suited them. Some of the municipalities used the new scope for design. You have already introduced new community leadership models or are planning to change the model. In the canton of Lucerne, there are now enough communities with experience with the various models. The various models were reduced to four basic types: - CEO model: municipal council as a board of directors with an employed managing director as head of administration - delegate model: municipal council as a board of directors with one delegate as head of administration - management model: municipal council as a board of directors with strategic departmental responsibility Operative model: municipal council as a political leadership and administrative executive The study shows what experiences have been made with the new community leadership models. The following questions were examined in detail: - Which communities have which model? - What central considerations lead to a change in the community leadership model - Who was the initiator when introducing a new model? - What were the criteria for choosing the new model? - What were the expectations of the model? - Have the expectations of the model been met? - What would the community solve differently from today's perspective? - What are the experiences of the municipal council, the administration and the population with the new model? - What should be considered when changing the management model? - What are the advantages and disadvantages of each model?

Glaucoma (green star) is the main cause of irreversible blindness. It is estimated that more than 60 million people are affected worldwide, with an increasing incidence in the elderly. Treatment aims to lower the intraocular pressure and can be done with medication, laser surgery or surgery. During surgery, a small stent may be implanted in the eye to drain some of the eye fluid and lower the pressure inside the eye. In cooperation with Valsigna, the HSLU has developed a systematic design method for a new eye stent, with which the stent can be personalized to the patient and the safety and stability of the pressure adjustment is improved.

In order to assess this potential, a set of indicators for evaluation is being developed in the project. The home office quadrupled in Switzerland between 2001 and 2018. In 2018, around a quarter of all employees pursued this form of work. Of these, around 45% worked occasionally, 42% regularly (working less than 50%) and 13% mostly (working more than 50%) from home (Federal Statistical Office, 2019). The Work Smart Initiative, supported by the federal government and Swiss companies, attests to the fact that this flexible form of work should save greenhouse gases and increase family time and work productivity. These potentials address all three dimensions of sustainability: society, environment and economy. It is still a central question in transport, spatial and social sciences as to what potential the home office can actually develop. This fundamental question is to be re-examined from an interdisciplinary perspective against the current background: COVID-19 is not only developing into a medical, but also a social, economic and political mega-challenge. In just a few months we can look back on what is probably the most comprehensive case to illustrate the system dynamics of the home office.

The Hotel xy in z is an attractive 4* lifestyle business hotel in the center of the city of z and is characterized by a very good occupancy rate during the week. However, utilization on weekends and during holiday periods is suboptimal. Hotel xy has various means (finances) and an expandable or convertible infrastructure (rooms) to make certain structural changes to increase its attractiveness. As a possible direction in this regard, a significant expansion of the hitherto rather modest wellness zone was discussed by the board of directors. For this, Hotel xy needed calculations of the market potential and a neutral assessment of the market opportunities. The Institute for Tourism Economics at the Lucerne School of Economics was therefore commissioned to calculate the market potential of a generous expansion of the wellness zone to include a Roman-Irish facility that would be accessible (ie public) to both hotel guests and non-residents. For this purpose, on the one hand, a competition analysis was carried out and, on the other hand, data was collected on the demand side (3 different survey groups).",," Wagenseil Urs,  Jost Manuela"

In a measurement project, the interior climate of today's vehicles is to be examined. The interior climate in buses is a relevant parameter for the satisfaction of passengers throughout the year. This is also shown by the numerous customer feedbacks that the bus companies receive every year. Relatively few studies (measurements) are available on the quantification and qualification of the indoor climate. In practice, the setting of the HVAC systems in bus operations is often carried out over several iterations by adjusting the set target values. Measured values are only available in rare cases. There is no uniform procedure between the various suppliers as to how the temperature is set and regulated. With the newly published VDV publication 236 11/2018, the VDV (Association of German Transport Companies) has created a basis with information and requirements for HVAC systems in buses. The recommendations contained therein are extensive and can be applied to new tenders for buses. In a measurement project, the interior climate of vehicles currently in operation is to be examined in the climate chamber. Vehicles procured today and their room conditioning systems will remain in service for another 12-20 years. Therefore, an examination of current vehicles makes sense in order to obtain optimization information for the remaining service life.

The KISmur facade system is a completely mineral, double-shell system consisting of an inner brick supporting shell and an outer layer of insulating brick that is open to diffusion. The outer shell assumes the function of external insulation, which is common in conventional masonry in new buildings. The outer insulation layer of the KISmur facade system could also be a good solution for energy-related renovations. In this case, instead of the usual external insulation made of EPS, rock wool or similar, a pre-walled insulating brick layer would be used and horizontally connected to the existing masonry. The focus of the application would be on buildings from the 1960s and 1990s, which need to be energetically renovated. The aim of the project is to use hygrothermal simulations and life cycle assessment calculations to compare the physical behavior and environmental impact (embodied energy, greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact points) of KISmur energetic refurbishments with conventional solutions."," Manz Heinrich,  King Marvin,  Domingo Irigoyen Silvia", Bionda Davide

In times of high electricity production, hydrogen gas is to be produced using power-to-gas technology to store electricity. The aim of this work is to describe the energy-economic embedding of electrolysis. For this purpose, three operating strategies were developed, which were mathematically modeled to forecast operating hours and the amount of electricity consumed. The strategy for storing surplus renewable electricity describes the storage potential of the regionally generated surplus solar electricity. The strategy for purchasing electricity via the electricity exchange describes the targeted purchase of electricity at times of high production from renewable energies and low demand. Lower production costs for hydrogen can be achieved through targeted operation of the electrolysers to reduce balancing energy (third operating strategy)."," Wellig Beat,  Hoffmann Sebastian", Sulzer Sabine

This mass data is to be examined by means of typological analysis. The monitoring of buildings is currently changing from a technically desirable to a legally required method of verifying the sensible operation of buildings. The background to this development is the sometimes considerable difference between planning and operating data, the so-called ""performance gap"". In the scientific and technical field, the procedure is usually such that a hypothesis is made about certain dependencies in the data. Through the hypothesis, a first subjective abstraction is already formed from the data, which can lead to misinterpretations. In addition, other existing connections may remain hidden. The aim of the project is to examine building data for structures and relationships that remain hidden from the statistically based engineering analysis methods described above. The method of topological data analysis is used for this, whereby it is essential that there are no a priori questions/hypothesis. The central result of the analysis is thus ""the question of the question"" within the data. Using the example of data from typical Swiss buildings, which have been measured qualitatively and quantitatively over several years, the methodology of topological data analysis is to be tested for added value compared to conventional methods. The central questions are: • Which questions can be derived from the data? (Question about the hypothesis) • What are the appropriate evaluation methods for these questions? (Question on the methodology) • Which data must be recorded as a minimum and which can easily be left out?

What are their motivations? How do those involved express themselves in this regard? The learning of music by seniors in groups was documented in four short films. Learning music in old age will gain in importance in view of the demographic change with an increase in older and habitually education-oriented people in society. Relevant studies refer to the preventive effects of active music making in old age for a life with a high subjective well-being. There is therefore an interest in society as a whole to enable older people to make their own music and to participate in music education offers, to create relevant meeting spaces and to reach them in their living environment. Lesson offers, forms and content must, however, be tailored to the individual needs of older music learners. Likewise, potentials and limitations must be known and a repertoire of methods for the latter must be available, which is why teachers for musical work in this age segment should have a specific competence profile. The film documentation at hand takes up today's educational demands of the 50+ generation, accompanies older people in four film portraits while observing them as they learn music and thus draws a positive image of old age. The people portrayed give insights into their individual learning and making music together, report on their motivations and create connections to life-historical determinants as well as to their current life-world orientations. An additional professional perspective is created through interviews with music teachers. In a ""Focus on Dementia"" the possibilities of including dementia sufferers in senior music groups are discussed.

So far, however, no satisfactory connection to the substance has been possible. In this project, the fusion between 3D printing (including using a classic 3D printer and 3D pen) and textile color application processes (including raised textile printing using Hypertube) is to be developed."," Khalsa Chhail,  Wehrli Daniel,  Schumann Marie", Adler Françoise

With this joint strategy, the four cantons are underscoring their desire to work together to develop the area around the Gotthard into a coherent living and economic area. The long-term goal of the project is to develop the Gotthard region into an unmistakable attraction, into a unique Swiss destination. The brand identity and positioning were defined together with the project management of ""Regio San Gottardo"". These served as the basis for the development of the word and picture mark. A clear design briefing for the design agency and suggestions for a meaningful brand system (brand hierarchy) were also developed. In the course of the project, the following questions were answered: What is the relevant sales market for the ""Regio San Gottardo"" (geographically, according to product/service categories)? Who are the target groups and other reference/stakeholder groups? What associations or ideas about “Gotthard” are anchored in their minds today? What other brands can be identified as competitors? What should the ""Regio San Gottardo"" brand stand for (internal view)? What are their characteristics, competencies, core values, beliefs? What are their special features, unique selling points? What relevant benefits does the brand offer its target and reference groups? What target identity of the ""San Gottardo"" brand should be built up in the minds of the target and reference groups in the future? How should the brand be positioned in the context of similar, competing brands? What emotions should the brand trigger in the target and reference groups? How can the brand cover the heterogeneity of the offers (energy, tourism and mobility, regional products such as food, nature, etc.) and enable expansion into other offer areas? If the creation of an umbrella brand makes sense: how does it relate to sub-brands/sub-brands (brand system/hierarchy)?

The DeepWood project faced the challenge of how to collaborate with several disciplines simultaneously in a common model. The model of the timber construction planning by Cadmakers in Vancouver served as a model. The question was: Can this business model, can the planning that takes place at Cadmakers, be transferred 1:1 to Switzerland? The DeepWood project team used the same industrial platform and its structures as an example. Based on the idea that the ""noise"" of the interface problems of current BIM projects can be switched off in this approach, new structures for future real-time-based, cross-company and collaborative planning in timber construction were exploratively developed and tested in two living labs. At the same time, a performance matrix was developed that provides instructions on how architects and specialist planners in prefabricated timber construction can cope with project progress in a timber construction-oriented manner. The project team was challenged by the collaboration in the living labs and in the research project. Away from the logic of common architecture and construction software, know-how in modeling was built up on an industrial platform. The desire not to encounter any interface problems has not entirely come true. The development of know-how in practice for modeling on the industry platform turned out to be difficult. Nevertheless, added value in parameterized planning and the component-based design approach was identified in intensive workshops with experts worldwide and first users in Switzerland. Previously rigid project structures can thus be dissolved and in-depth variant studies can be carried out in parallel over a longer period of time. It is also possible to make simple adjustments very late in the process. With these insights, a second Living Lab was started to better understand the methodology and develop a new disruptive planning structure. This disruptive DeepWood process structure paves the way for a new understanding of planning. The Living Lab 2 was carried out by a design team from the two universities and Helbling PLM Solutions and proved to be a great success. The result is a new understanding of the process away from rigid phases and the associated new possibilities of making decisions in a project only when dependencies and effects have been better clarified. Despite the success of Living Lab 2, it is still difficult to transfer the Cadmakers service model to Switzerland. On the one hand, there is still a need for research on the technical side. On the other hand, the entry barrier for planners is very high, the lock-in effect has also challenged the research team and the development of qualified specialists for modeling represents another challenge."," Schuchert Christian Lars,  Schultz Elke,  Hansch Franziska,  Malevez Jara,  Wacker Pascal,  Schwehr Peter,  Bucher Stefan,  Walker Timo J.", Geier Sonja

Young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 were given the opportunity to set up a self-organized theatre. The young director project offered young adults from the Lucerne area the opportunity to artistically and operationally manage a self-organized theater stage. This project was unique in Switzerland. For four years now, it has enabled young adults of different ages and backgrounds to organize their own form of cultural participation. The young management - which in the first season gave itself the name ""Kulturkeller Winkel"" - received a four-year performance agreement from the Luzerner Theater for the former theater space. This agreement formed the framework for the voluntary commitment of the leaders and the opportunities for the target groups to participate. In the first two seasons, the young team was accompanied and supported by a coach in the group formation process. The sponsored groups, which were given the opportunity to rehearse and perform, expanded their artistic skills and worked on their view of society in their projects. Young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 break away from their original environment. They are reorienting themselves and are dependent on spaces in which they can organize and meet freely. Childhood sociologists see great social potential in letting children and young people design their own spaces, giving them responsibility and letting them define the rules of social interaction themselves. The project Jungintendanz wanted to explore new forms of cultural participation of young people - in the conviction that flat hierarchies promote creativity and independent action. The pilot project should help to balance the unequal distribution of cultural capital within society by enabling cultural participation. In addition, long-term access barriers for young people should be dismantled and cross-cultural artistic forms of expression should be developed.

The TESS project is the follow-up project to the Innosuisse project ""Dagsmejan - high performance sleepwear"", which was completed at the end of 2017. In the project, the research field is expanded to include the entire sleep system (sleepwear, duvet, mattress) and its influence on bodily functions during sleep. The central question deals with the interaction of textile surface construction (material density and looseness, basis weight) and functionality. This occurs when, for example, the duvet and sleepwear interact. The investigations focus on two factors: On the one hand, research is being carried out into how the nature of fibers and the finish of yarns can influence the function of the textile and in which surface constructions these properties can be fully developed. For this purpose, the body mapping technique is extended to the entire sleep system. Furthermore, the textile surfaces are examined for their emotional, haptic and tactile qualities in order to be able to formulate an evaluation system with which the textiles can be classified from a perceptual-psychological point of view."," Weber-Hansen Andrea,  Willi Benjamin,  Egloff Brigitte,  Bachmann Helbling Carola,  Khalsa Chhail,  Stamm Lara", Müggler Zumstein Isabel Rosa

The project addresses two main topics in the ""Smart City Switzerland"" concept: - Smart grids and energy supply - Active buildings Networks already have to be able to store and move energy and exchange it ""real-time"" with high efficiency in order to achieve optimal load distribution. We are in a paradigm shift, away from the concept of water storage power plants, which consume excess energy and supply additional energy to the grid at peak times, towards a concept of completely avoiding energy peaks through intelligent load distribution, starting at state level, across regions, cities and municipalities down to individual energy consumers and devices in households (“virtual power plant”). The decentralization of energy production includes discontinuous sources such as wind and solar energy, making households both energy consumers and energy suppliers.

The project initially dealt with fundamental questions, problems and methods of applied research at universities of applied sciences and then implemented the knowledge gained in research practice. Based on qualitative interviews and surveys of high school students and teachers, preferences, wishes and problems were determined and a method was developed from this - taking into account the current knowledge of general pedagogy - which gives the students an experience-oriented, active approach to the implementation of music with a simultaneous theoretical reference. The survey of the students showed that practically everyone is enthusiastic about pop music, a large proportion would like more practice and the vast majority would like less or no music theory. It turned out that the teachers are aware of the hostility to theory and find it difficult to include pop music, because the basic musical quality of pop music does not lie in its tonal structure, but in the autonomy of those involved. The aim was therefore to develop a method that enables schoolchildren to create their own pop songs in the sense of an activation that should last beyond music lessons. The solution: With the help of a chord table, the students are instructed in arranging and performing their own pop songs. This gives them an initial insight into the function and practical application of the theory of harmony. At the same time, through their own practice, they experience music as a community experience. The method was then tried out with two test classes and then evaluated. A high level of acceptance by students and teachers could be determined and some weaknesses and problems of the method could be corrected or improved. The result is an evaluated method that enables the students to be musically active beyond the music lessons and to sing popular, up-to-the-minute pop songs themselves - which is not possible when the teacher writes pop song arrangements. The developed method relies on the activation and autonomy of the students and combines independent activity with a practical and therefore accepted reference to the otherwise unpopular music theory (harmony theory)."," Huber Jürg,  Camp Marc-Antoine", Ringli Dieter

It draws attention to an aesthetic and emancipatory dimension of education through micro-practical analyzes between art and pedagogy. The project considers the dimension of aesthetic education in two ways: on the one hand, education at art colleges and in art classes is based on aesthetic practices; thus she cannot do without the structures of the aesthetic. On the other hand, contemporary art often uses didactic and pedagogical models and thus creates its own educational situations. This results in two research fields: Research field 1 (Silvia Henke): Aesthetics of Education. Based on Schiller's concept of aesthetic education, which reappears in recent art theories, the project will examine didactic figures (parable, model, Lehrstück, example) that are equally relevant to aesthetics and education. In the following, through micropractical investigations, moments of aesthetic education in the classroom as well as in artistic work will be concretely described and new situations for the interweaving of theory and practice will be created. The aim is also to expand the concept of practice and at the same time to make it more concrete. Research Field 2 (Wiktoria Furrer): Radical Pedagogies in Art (phd) The research field focuses on artistic practices that work with the help of pedagogical models and participatory formats such as workshops, platforms, laboratories, collaborations, temporary schools and artist-run institutions. As performative, process-oriented, dialogical or investigative settings with their own micro-practices and methods such as Oskar Hansen's ""Visual Games"" or ""The Silent University Principles and Demands"" by Ahmet Ögüt, their core lies in the work on spaces of experience and forms of knowledge. Radical pedagogies, according to the thesis, develop an aesthetic thinking that extends to an aesthetics of existence by combining aesthetic and social processes. Both projects contribute to the contouring of the practice and micro-practice of aesthetic thinking, which can be used for art education at art colleges, secondary schools as well as for non-institutional educational and mediation contexts. The entire project is closely linked to the sub-projects of the other universities, which work together in regular conferences, meetings and workshops. The results of the project should result in concrete impulses and further initiatives for aesthetic thinking at art schools.", Furrer Wiktoria, Henke Dean Silvia

The project is developing a 'Smart Ennoblement Factory', which is positioned in a market field in which a high degree of individualization and flexibility through ennoblement is required. The user-centered development of this cyber-physical solution is the core, which creates a previously non-existent network between designers/customers, the machine and the associated systems and tools, and Saurer AG. This enables the production of small batch sizes and a new form of aesthetic expression in design. The project also aims to ensure the compatibility of formal aesthetic demands on the part of design and the demand for sustainable textile production by examining the digital possibilities from this perspective and using them accordingly."," Jensen Björn,  Arnold Jaro,  Bozzini Pascal,  Ehrler Roman", Kirchhofer Pierre

The project is based on the hypothesis that on the clarinet the most valuable results can be achieved both in terms of sound aesthetics and artistically with a technique of sound generation that is defined as an action that straightens the body in combination with air flow, support for breathing and shaping of the embouchure. To test this assumption, physiological-music-medical, artistic and pedagogical data were collected in several experiments and then compared with each other using a statistical model. The playing of 21 clarinettists was objectively mapped with regard to the activation of muscle groups in both the usual postures and the postures examined here using electromyography measurements (EMG). The research team also recorded the clarinet sounds produced and analyzed them as acoustic signals (prism analysis). In a subsequent online survey, sound examples in which certain body postures could be detected by specific muscle activation using EMG were assessed by the human ear according to sound aesthetic criteria (e.g. timbre, flexibility of the tone control, smoothness of the legato, quality of the staccato, reliability of the respons intonation stability). The evaluation of this survey clearly showed that listeners prefer sound samples that were coupled with the examined upright playing posture. The development of a statistical model also made it possible to use the prism characteristics of a sound to predict how a listener would judge the overall impression. Finally, in a practical phase, an exercise repertoire based on the tested postures was evaluated with beginner and advanced students. The further developed exercise repertoire should be able to be used for study as well as for teaching and performance at a professional level. – The project team included professionals from the fields of music and music pedagogy, physiology, physiotherapy, acoustics, electromyography, data analysis and statistics. The project was led by the Institute for Music Education at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (www.hslu.ch/musik/m-forschung-entwicklung/m-musik-ismuse.htm) in cooperation with the Institute for Data Analysis and Process Design at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences Sciences (www.idp.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/idp.html) and the ETH Zurich.

The project was based on the hypothesis that cultural differences and new needs due to migration and social diversity with regard to the design and use of residential buildings and settlements often affect semi-public and communal spaces as well as the transitions between private, semi-public and public spaces. The importance of transitions and interfaces is linked to the question of how important community, cohesion or neighborhood are on the one hand and opportunities for retreat on the other. In the project, therefore, the question of the integration-promoting effect of common rooms and structural transitions between private, semi-public and public spaces was investigated in particular. With a theoretical and conceptual tripartition, the project was designed as a preliminary study for an application-oriented main study. In the first part, the findings from the international literature were compiled, which were examined on the one hand with regard to the effects of social diversity on building and housing - in particular public and semi-public spaces - and on the other hand with regard to the specific housing needs of migrants. In the second part, exploratory one-on-one interviews were conducted with key people who know about social diversity and the challenges it faces. In addition, the results of a Vienna conference on interethnic living were processed. The third part is dedicated to eight ""diversity"" housing projects in Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands in the form of short portraits, which have taken into account in particular the special planning characteristics of the mediation between public and private areas. In addition to a brief characterization of the individual settlements, it was evaluated which planning objectives should be met in terms of user needs and diversity aspects and how the architecture was used accordingly.",," Willener Alex,  Juppien Angelika,  Geissbühler Dieter,  Akkaya Gülcan"

The aim of the project was to anchor diversity as an extended dimension of gender in the Music Department of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and to promote diversity skills. Accordingly, a series of events open to the public gave staff and students at the Department of Music various insights into the subject of music and diversity over the course of a year. The series of events raised awareness of the tension between one's own and the other and between self-affirmation and othering, thereby referring to normative frameworks and their alternatives. In particular, it should be shown how domination and discrimination mechanisms are inscribed in music-related action and shape its structures. Last but not least, the exchange was about freeing the differences based on social background, gender, ethnic group, age, religion, etc. from stereotypical attributions, prejudices and evaluations in order to be able to recognize and experience differences as creative potential. The overarching goal was to focus on dealing with diversity and inequality in a respectful and appreciative manner.

The content and Excel tools have been tried and tested, but some of them are getting old and can usually only be used offline and by downloading from Ilias. Due to the fact that not only students are working more and more at mobile workstations, there is a growing need to be able to combine the contents and tools of the module and use them in the form of a mobile system/application if possible. A first survey among the alumni of the last 5 semesters showed that an rcc app would be used significantly.

The project examined the auditory impressions that animal sounds evoke in humans. In listening experiments, recorded animal voices were played back and described by participants. The listening experiments showed that animal voices are located between music, speech and noises from everyday life, especially between acoustic and audiovisual media. The direct auditory experience of played animal sounds aroused a whole spectrum of individually or collectively named associations. One's own musical biography, as a music practitioner as well as a music listener, was shown to be an important point of reference and central imaginative space when describing animal voices. In addition to the reference to music, experiences of similar everyday sounds that do not come from animals were also mentioned. Biographical memories of the corresponding animal sounds heard were also awakened. Music-related practices also shape the scientific perception and interpretation of animal sounds. The graphic music notation as well as later the sonograms (visualization of sounds on the computer) are used to record and analyze chants and calls visually. In terms of the history of knowledge, there are interesting parallels in the tools used that influence and shape musical or bioacoustic knowledge and specific listening practices. If you do research on animal sounds, you will also come across the eco-classic Silent Spring by Rachel Carson again and again. Through the dystopian image of a silent spring without birdsong, birds became an important symbol of the environmental protection movement that began in the late 1960s. In the following decade, the human influence on the sound environment became a topic that sound researchers, composers and sound artists negotiate in their works. The project Seeking Birdscapes: Contemporary Listening and Recording Practices in Ornithology and Environmental Sound Art, which arose from these case studies, sometimes examines the relationship between music/sound art and ecology through listening and recording practices."," Simonett Helena,  Camp Marc-Antoine", Jäggi Patricia

The project aims at the socio-political and socio-scientific central debate about inclusion and exclusion (""inclusion and exclusion"") of individual and entire population groups in society. The focus is on the questions of how the welfare state must continue to develop and how the social dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, especially with regard to welfare state norms, can be understood and described from a social science perspective. Social affairs and social work are essentially related to the preventive prevention and secondary processing of solidified multiple exclusions. The question of the mechanisms of exclusion and inclusion is therefore the appropriate cross-cutting topic in their search for successful methods of intervention. Dealing with the dialectics of inclusion and exclusion in modern society is central to reflecting on the conditions of social work, both from a societal and professional point of view. The topic is therefore also central to the development of competence in connection with the establishment of the master's degree courses. It also makes it possible to develop a common perspective on previous research projects and thus to develop the basis for a thematically coherent expansion of research."," Mey Eva,  Seiler Manfred,  Mösch Peter", Schmid Peter A.

The ensemble was one of the first professional string quartet formations in the modern sense and developed a groundbreaking and independent new quartet style. Numerous audio recordings made between 1924 and 1926 document the interpretative approach of this quartet and cemented its fame in a lasting way. The aim of the two-year research project is to document and research the history of the Quatuor du Flonzaley and its extraordinary art of chamber music interpretation. Upon completion of the project, the research results will be published in the form of a phono monograph as a book with two CDs: This hybrid form of publication, developed at the Lucerne School of Music, makes image sources, written sources and sound recordings accessible in a bibliophilic and adequate manner. It enables a well-founded presentation of the history and music of the Quatuor du Flonzaley, which is aimed not only at experts but also at a general audience interested in chamber music and is distributed via the usual channels of the music market. The most important sources for this research project include numerous letters, photographs, concert reports, interviews, audio documents, musical texts with handwritten entries by the musicians and other written documents. The written and graphic sources provide a rich basis for organizational history and sociological studies on the Quatuor du Flonzaley. The interpretive approach of the ensemble can be viewed on the basis of the annotated notes and, above all, on the basis of the sound recordings: With the analysis software Lucerne Audio Recording Analyzer (LARA), developed at the Lucerne School of Music, tempo design, articulation, sound balance/timbre, dynamics and intonation are differentiated way shown. The Fonoteca Nazionale Svizzera in Lugano is involved in this project as a practical partner: the Fonoteca has the expertise and infrastructure to professionally restore early sound recordings. She is responsible for editing and producing the sound recordings.

The research project summarized the current state of research on the subject of sexual health in people with cognitive disabilities and gave an overview of the current supply of publicly funded outpatient offers for sexual health in German-speaking Switzerland in the fields of disability assistance, sexual health and victim and perpetrator counseling. In addition, against the background of a needs analysis of people with cognitive disabilities, it described their need for barrier-free access to information and communication in terms of availability, access, acceptability and quality as well as participation in offers. The data collected in German-speaking Switzerland between 2013 and 2015 on publicly accessible offers of sexual health for adults with cognitive impairments show that such offers are generally available in the three work areas of help for the disabled, sexual health and counseling for victims and perpetrators. They cover both the big cities and the rural areas. However, there are differences in the type and scope of the offers in the German-speaking Swiss cantons. There are various important gaps in need, such as a lack of opportunities to meet people that allow them to get to know each other better and take into account the different needs of sexual orientation. In addition, information and communication for people with cognitive disabilities are not sufficiently addressed to them, for example by being written in easy language. The same applies to the physical environment, whose accessibility is often not or only partially guaranteed. Our research also showed that there are only a few professionals who have professional qualifications in both the subject of disability and sexuality. In addition, it became apparent that the participation of people with cognitive disabilities in the compilation, implementation and evaluation of offers still has significant potential for development. In summary, there is a considerable need for action or catching up on the part of the facilities in terms of the appropriate realization of equal access to offers and services in the field of sexual health for people with cognitive disabilities."," Müller Irene,  Lechner Katharina", Kunz Daniel

In the course of security measures, stocks are digitized and the Engeler and Kuster estates in particular are processed. The Roothuus Gonten, the competence center for folk music in the Alpstein region, has sound recordings, including original recordings of traditional music, singing and conversations. The original recordings are mostly unique, which are important for the importance of the Roothuus as an archive, for future research interest in the archive holdings and for the music history of the region around the Alpstein. In this project by Roothuus Gonten and the Lucerne School of Music, general security measures are being taken for the sound carriers, including magnetic wire coils from the Linus Koster Collection, and those original recordings are being identified that urgently need to be digitized. The estates of Margaret Engeler and Linus Koster will be scientifically evaluated and the music and conversations on the recordings will be inventoried. The evaluations should contribute to the development of historical sound recordings from the Appenzell region. The Engeler estate also contains many written documents that can be used for the planned mediation. Engeler's recordings are not only of interest for the music history of the region, but also a historically relevant testimony to folk music research by women, such as Hanny Christen before her and Brigitte Bachmann-Geiser, also from the 1970s."," Pfäffli Daniel,  Wey Yannick", Camp Marc-Antoine

This study shows that vacationers generally want to travel sustainably, but are not yet willing to pay significantly more for a ""sustainable"" vacation. The buzzword sustainability occupies the tourism industry and raises questions. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has conducted a wide-ranging study in view of the forum that will take place next week in the Lucerne Museum of Transport. The first part - an Internet survey of over 6,000 tourists in eight countries - dealt with the question of what tourists understand by sustainable tourism and whether the issue of sustainability plays a role in the choice of holiday destination and booking behavior. In the second part, Swiss Kuoni customers were asked how much more they would be willing to pay for “sustainable holidays”. Almost 30,000 customers of Kuoni and Helvetic Tours in Switzerland received a questionnaire via the Internet. 16 percent or a good 4,800 customers took part in the survey. The researchers measured customers' willingness to spend more on sustainability, namely a safari trip to South Africa and a beach holiday in the Maldives. The results hardly differ from each other. Conclusion: Although the customer would very much like to book sustainable offers, they are only willing to pay more for them to a very limited extent and only if they perceive their holiday as sustainable in all respects. In concrete terms, this means: The more sustainable the factors of the trip offered are (local products, working conditions or treatment of the environment), the greater the likelihood that this offer will be taken into account. However, in this case, too, the willingness does not go so far as to pay the effective additional price, which is shown, among other things, by the example of CO2 compensation. The first part of the empirical study in eight countries already showed that cost awareness pushes sensitivity to the environment into the background. The weather/climate and price factors play a much greater role when booking a holiday trip. ""Sustainability is not important and is the second to last of the eight criteria to choose from,"" the authors recognized. Nevertheless, for tourism operators who want to place greater emphasis on sustainability in their product range, there is a potential of around 20 percent of travelers who named the topic of sustainability in third place or higher when making their decision."," Durrer Eggerschwiler Beatrice,  Egli Hannes,  Schwarz Jürg,  Stettler Jürg,  Christen Jakob Mariana,  Lutzenberger Martin,  Spillmann Peter,  Unruh-Bodin Tina Henriette", Wehrli Roger
571,40304,The Fundaments of Groove: A Systematic Exploration of Drum Patterns in Popular Music,https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/hochschule-luzern/forschung/projekte/detail/?pid=3510,Abgeschlossen,2016,2017,Music Performance Research Projekte,"The Fundaments of Groove: A Systematic Exploration of Drum Patterns in Popular Music The project examined the groove qualities of 250 iconic drum beats as part of a large-scale online listening experiment. The drums play a central role in Western popular music; it is an integral part of the instrumentation. Songs without drums hardly ever occur in these genres. The rhythmic patterns of the percussion are highly relevant for the definition of a regular pulse and for the establishment of a stable rhythmic order on which the dancers' body movements are based. In the project ""The Fundaments of Groove"" we assumed that the drums are of great importance for the groove phenomenon. We examined the impact of 250 iconic drum patterns played by 50 of the most influential drummers in funk, rock, metal, fusion, R&B or pop. The drum beats were transcribed and performative aspects (timing, dynamics) extracted. Finally, the patterns were reconstructed on the basis of samples as realistic-sounding sound recordings. The reconstructed drum patterns are available to other researchers as easy-to-manipulate audio samples for further experiments (https://www.grooveresearch.ch/). The groove qualities of the reconstructed drum patterns were evaluated by 665 listeners in an online listening experiment. The evaluations revealed numerous small rhythmic effects: For example, more complex drum rhythms produced a greater groove effect. However, this effect depended significantly on the musical expertise of the survey participants: professional and amateur musicians reacted positively to complexity, while amateurs were just as happy to move to simple rhythms. However, personal taste in music had a much greater influence: the participants rated a drum pattern significantly better if they thought it came from a style they like or from a song they know. Groove research has so far looked for universal factors, for musical characteristics that have a similar effect on the majority of people. The new results call this approach into question: Depending on the stylistic or cultural context, there can be completely different factors that trigger people's desire to dance. The next project will be dedicated to these contexts and factors. To this end, we revised the Groove questionnaire to better distinguish gustatory from motor responses. The new questionnaire is currently being tested as part of a broad survey: (https://www.hslu.ch/groove-questionnaire/ (English). The project results were published in the journal PLoS ONE (see publications)."," Hoesl Florian,  Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Sandmeier Nicole,  Bechtold Toni Amadeus", Senn Olivier

With this project, the practical questions in improvisation groups were discussed in depth using specific announcements, exercises and concepts. These resources, which can be used as teaching tools and which complement analysis of recorded free improvisation and reflective discussion, expand awareness and competence of procedural interactions in free improvisation. Furthermore, the central concepts in the discourse on free improvisation were discussed.

An international conference (Lucerne, September 27/28, 2019) prompted the presentation of the publication. The conference had the intention of getting into conversation with improvising people. The exchange of objectives and communication methods was the core topic. However, improvisation was also fundamentally addressed and viewed in different socio-cultural contexts. Because improvisation is omnipresent in working life as well as in non-professional everyday life, in most communication situations and even in routine actions, without being particularly emphasized there as a production form of communication or other interpersonal behavior.

The social system is subject to constant change. The management of organizations is becoming increasingly complex. It is important to develop strategies, ensure quality and keep an eye on risks. But: A simple management tool for the management or supervisory bodies has not yet existed. The fitness radar for social organizations now fills this gap. A new tool that researchers from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts together with practitioners and the Aid Governance Foundation have developed specifically for the social sector. The fitness radar is an internet-based application for self-evaluation. The instrument can be used to examine the entire organization for development potential. And all this at an extremely low price: A license is available from as little as CHF 100 per employee. The contact persons listed on this page will be happy to advise interested organizations. Keep your entire organization on the radar The fitness radar allows a holistic evaluation of the entire organization. It shows at a glance where there is potential for development and helps with continuous further development. The employees of social organizations can easily use the tool. The effort required to collect the information is minimal - it takes less than two hours per person. At the same time, however, a high level of coverage of all topics that are important for the organization is achieved - and this at all hierarchical levels. Because the question often arises: Does the strategy from “above” also come from “below”? Do the board members really know what problems arise in their daily work? The fitness radar provides decision-makers and employees with answers to these and many other questions. Detailed information on the instrument can be found under ""Documents"" at the bottom of this website.

The spectrum of challenging behavior is broad and includes, among other things, self-aggression, third-party aggression and damage to property. What is certain, however, is that these behaviors are not only an expression of the challenge faced by the people concerned themselves, but that all other people involved are also challenged in dealing with them. So far, there are hardly any research results on this topic in Switzerland. The overarching research question is: How is the challenging behavior of adults with cognitive impairments dealt with in institutions for the disabled in Switzerland? The research project is divided into five project phases: 1st phase: A national comprehensive survey (written standardized questionnaire) in all institutions for adults with cognitive impairments in Switzerland provides for the first time representative information on the frequency (number of people with challenging behavior) and the types of challenging behavior . 2nd phase: A partially standardized survey (written questionnaire) of reference persons provides representative data on the emergence of challenging behaviors, on the institutional handling of them and the resulting consequences. 3rd phase: Interviews or video analyzes with adults who are cognitively impaired and show challenging behavior capture the perspective of those affected. 4th phase: Group discussions with all people involved in the support (interdisciplinary teams to the 20 people from phase 3) enable a system-ecological analysis of the specific handling of challenging behaviors. Factors that help and hinder a successful fit between the individual and the environment are worked out, taking into account the various system levels (micro-, meso-, exo-systems). In addition, 20 individual interviews are conducted with one parent or closest relative in order to capture their perspective. 5th phase: The data evaluation and triangulation of results produce results on the frequency, forms, emergence, handling and consequences of challenging behavior in institutions in the field of disabilities. A system-ecological best-practice model is derived that contains beneficial and hindering factors in dealing with challenging behavior and includes the perspectives of the clientele, the accompanying persons (interdisciplinary teams) and the relatives.

The textile care system ""Refresh-Butler"" is a multi-functional device with which a wide variety of textile types can be cared for in a gentle way. Functions include freshening (removing odors), de-creasing, sanitizing (eliminating germs and bacteria) and drying wet laundry. A heat pump is integrated into the textile care system for gentle and energy-efficient drying of the clothes. The process air in the drying room absorbs water due to evaporation and dries the clothes. The process air flows into the evaporator of the heat pump, is cooled below the dew point and water vapor is condensed. The cold, dehumidified process air flows through the condenser and is heated up. The air flows back into the drying chamber and the cycle begins again. The Competence Center Thermal Energy Systems & Process Engineering developed a mathematical-physical simulation model with which the heat pump can be designed and the drying process can be theoretically examined. This makes it possible to determine the optimal configuration of the heat pump for the drying process without having to set up various complex functional models. In order to further increase energy efficiency, the drying process was experimentally examined in the laboratory. Optimization measures were derived from this and implemented, which improves the heat and mass transfer between the textile and the process air.

Various methods for measuring the quality of public transport were discussed and evaluated in the study. From the analyzes and surveys, suggestions were made for the further development of the controlling of service quality in companies and for the integration of quality into the payment procedure in public transport.", Schad Helmut, Sonderegger Roger

Various ""strategic"" mergers of larger municipalities are sought in order to better exploit the regional development potential and to better position city regions (e.g. ""Strong City Region Lucerne""). These mergers are based on the idea that a city region with a common strategy and combined resources can develop more dynamically without institutional obstacles and be able to assert itself better in the intensifying location competition. The question of how the demonstrably different needs of the population in the districts or quarters can be taken into account in the larger city is hardly discussed. It can be assumed that certain municipal tasks can be solved in a more needs-based and therefore also more efficient manner at the district/neighborhood level. The aim of the project was to show which public tasks can be solved more adequately or more efficiently at the level of the district/neighborhood and which institutional anchoring of the districts/neighbourhoods makes sense."," Amrhyn Eveline,  Willimann Ivo,  Jordi Kathrin,  Wandeler Moritz", Käppeli Stephan

The topic of bank profitability is of great interest from both a business and an economic perspective. Nevertheless, there are still significant gaps in this research area for the Swiss banking market. The importance of bank profitability on a micro and macro level makes this topic important from an academic point of view, from a bank management point of view and from a bank regulatory point of view. In particular, there is great interest in finding out which factors have a significant impact on bank profitability. A corresponding profitability analysis can - in addition to a valuable contribution to research or science - also be of great benefit for the various banks. With the ability to identify the critical factors of profitability, immediate benefit can be generated by identifying best practices, uncovering inefficiencies and thus showing ways to increase performance. In a further step, there is also the possibility of examining and systematically analyzing the profitability of the various banks and banking groups in a cross-sectional comparison (benchmarking analysis). In addition, the corresponding results are also relevant for politicians and supervisory authorities, as they receive information about the effects of (de)regulatory measures, mergers and market structures on the performance of the various banks, for example.",, Dietrich Andreas

This means that pension solutions and communication can be tailored to customer needs for the first time. The issue of ""financial literacy with a focus on old-age provision"" will gain in importance for both companies and insured persons due to the financing difficulties in the 1st and 2nd pillars. The reason is that the persistently low interest rate environment means that low-risk investments such as government bonds yield too low returns, in particular in order to sustainably finance the promises of benefits in the 2nd pillar prescribed in the BVG (Occupational Pension Act). Pension funds are therefore forced to take more risks in their investment strategy. These risks mean that performance in second sows can no longer be guaranteed with certainty. The insured therefore bear these risks, but in different ways depending on the strategy of the fund. However, little is currently known as to whether the insured are aware of these risks, know about them and what willingness they have to bear them. This is where the project comes in: The aim is to use a survey to increase the knowledge of pension risks and their attitudes among those insured in the 2nd pillar. Collect opinions on future developments in the pension sector. Based on these findings, different customer segments are defined in 8/50 dependence on knowledge, risk preferences and socio-demographic factors. A suitable tool is being developed for this purpose. The benefit of the business partners lies in the fact that they can improve their products and communication tailored to these customer segments. The financial benefit results from the generation of new customers and cost savings. The economic benefit lies in raising public awareness of this escalating socio-economic risk. Awareness of the unavoidability of risky pensions requires more personal responsibility and voluntary retirement provision. The financial benefit lies in savings on Social Security benefits."," Perpignano Ersilia Adele,  Nikolussi Fabian,  Schreiber Florian,  Döhnert Karsten", Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne

Control is carried out according to its design within the framework of the center concept via market mechanisms and through the specific design of the control instruments of performance measurement, incentive system and transfer prices. In practice, there are always problems and discussions about the interaction of the control instruments. While some problems cannot be solved theoretically, the solution of other problem areas is opposed to company-specific strategic, structural or cultural framework conditions. The aim of the project was to develop an analysis and monitoring tool that supports the identification, observation and resolution of these problems. As part of the project, the CODEZ concept was developed, which allows an integrated view of the control instruments. The analysis of the practice partners was based on this. Using an online survey and interviews with selected responsible persons, it was determined how the control instruments are designed and where problems arise. In the groups examined, the performance of the decentralized units is assessed with different weightings based on EBIT, sales and FCF. A combination of these key figures usually forms the basis for calculating the bonuses. Against this background, it is surprising that, according to the opinion of the survey participants, the FCF is not fully understood by the management. The evaluations have also shown that the perception and assessment of the control instruments vary depending on the function. For example, controllers are less critical of the existing systems than CFOs or CEOs. Knowledge of transfer pricing is rather low among the survey participants. Not surprisingly, transfer pricing often leads to debate. The study has shown the importance of timely adjustments to performance measurement, incentive systems and transfer pricing when there are changes in corporate structure. The analysis and monitoring tool CODEZ-Wiki was developed on the basis of a comprehensive study of the literature and the three case studies. Thanks to various search strategies, the CODEZ-Wiki is used to find problems, their background and possible solutions quickly and effectively.

VIs are not real people, but artificially created avatars that are active in social media. Like human influencers, VIs have a large community and can influence their decisions and behavior. The role of the VI is becoming more and more important in digital marketing, as brand ambassadors they can adapt their behavior and appearance, contrary to that of their human competition, to the industry-specific characteristics. The activity of VIs manifests itself on different levels. Like human influencers, VIs can be thought leaders, promoting destinations, services, brands or ideas. Their special potential lies in the fact that they can be precisely tailored to the respective brand identity and the special features of the target group. The popularity and relevance of VIs has increased massively in recent years, which is reflected in the collaboration of VIs with brands such as Samsung, Prada, Chanel or Netflix.

Physical health problems (e.g. injuries and musculoskeletal disorders) and mental well-being limitations (e.g. fear of performing, stress and symptoms of depression) are common and often impede student success. Research has shown that music students are aware that nurturing their own well-being is a prerequisite for a successful career and that the responsibility for health promotion rests with them and their educational institutions. How can framework conditions be created that can both support and promote the health and well-being of our students in our facilities?

Due to their extensive musical experience and their extensive contact time, often in a 1-to-1 framework with the students, they are in a key position to lead and implement changes that are beneficial to the well-being of the students. Music performance researchers can help identify problems and provide access to evidence-based approaches to support this process. The HeLP ME (Health Literacy & Practices for Musicians' Empowerment) project takes on this task by focusing on the role of the lecturers - as health ambassadors within the music college. The project is funded by swissuniversities as part of the P-11 program to promote research-based teaching. Through a series of workshops, research surveys, and resource development strategies, HeLP ME seeks to bridge the gap between musicians' health research and the subject, field, and experiential knowledge of educators. In particular, the project aims to raise the awareness of the lecturers for the topics of health and well-being in order to initiate a culture of cooperation and knowledge transfer between research and teaching and to initiate the development of health promotion resources for our students."," Pfister Andreas,  Baldassarre Antonio,  Sigrist Carlo,  Rose Dawn Carole,  Rose Dawn,  Ungerer Marietta,  Doerk Michael,  Sandmeier Nicole,  Halter Valérie", Alessandri Elena

The aim of future research work is to develop a steel-reinforced sand-lime masonry wall to increase the load capacity in the event of an earthquake and to replace the reinforced concrete walls that are conventional in practice. Close cooperation between the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU T&A) and the company Hunziker Kalksandstein AG (HKS AG) is aimed at. As tests on brick masonry at the HSLU T&A have already shown, the shear load capacity and the deformation capacity can be increased with the help of reinforcement. With a significant increase in earthquake resistance of 250%, 4-5 storey buildings can be constructed entirely of masonry walls in selected earthquake zones. First tactile tests by the company HKS AG have also shown that the principle can also be applied to sand-lime brick masonry. To determine the load-bearing behavior, 4 wall tests are necessary, which are carried out at the HSLU T&A. The tests can be recalculated on the basis of physical models with regard to the load and the deformations can be estimated using approaches from the literature. Design diagrams and tables for use in practice are derived from the theoretical calculation and the findings from the tests. The new product is necessary to maintain the market position of HSK AG.

A livable window is a space containing space between inside and outside. It has always been known as a loggia, veranda, winter garden, etc. in architectural history. It consists of two constructive levels, which are mostly glazed, is unheated and is passively heated by solar gains, with the aim of making it possible to stay in the transitional periods and on sunny days even in winter (winter garden) and thus increase the living space seasonally expand. The two constructive layers can be closed and opened as desired in order to ventilate the habitable window and the apartment, to prevent overheating and to enable communication and intimacy by switching on layers - depending on the needs of the residents. The extended length of stay compared to a balcony opens up various usage scenarios.

The dynamic growth of tourism in the city of Lucerne in recent years and the increasing spatial and temporal concentration of visitor flows have led to discussions about the future development of tourism in the city of Lucerne. Accordingly, there are fundamental questions about the future of tourism in the city of Lucerne, which are being discussed as part of a participatory development process called ""Vision Tourism 2030"". With a survey of the Lucerne city population, the population's assessment of tourism was surveyed and active participation in the process was ensured. Over 1,500 residents took part in the survey. The target population of 72,532 people corresponded to the Lucerne city population aged 18 and over. The survey was personally mailed to 6,779 people in two waves between January 13 and February 23 based on a random sample. 1,530 people (response rate: 22.6%) completed the survey online or in writing upon request. Tourism awareness among the population of the city of Lucerne is present The results show that the population of the city of Lucerne has a fundamentally positive view of tourism and is aware of the benefits and importance of tourism. Tourism creates jobs. In addition, the city is very attractive for guests from all over the world, says the population. However, the results also show where the critical aspects of tourism are from the point of view of the population. The distribution of the benefits and costs of tourism is critically assessed, ie who benefits from tourism and who is affected by the negative consequences. The majority is of the opinion that the acceptable number of tourists in the city of Lucerne and especially in the old town has already been exceeded. It is therefore not surprising that Lucerne's urban population does not want any further increase in the number of tourists and that a majority supports stronger regulation and management of tourism. Results are taken into account in the strategy process for Vision Tourism 2030 In order to successfully advance the “Vision Tourism Lucerne 2030” project, the involvement of the relevant stakeholders – especially the population – and close coordination with the parallel Carregime strategy process of the city of Lucerne are decisive success factors in the strategy process . In addition to the population survey, the results from the impulse portal and other forms of participation are also taken into account. However, some of these had to be postponed due to the Covid19 crisis."," Hüsser Andreas,  Steffen Angela,  Eggli Florian,  Huck Lukas", Stettler Jürg

Around the middle of the 19th century, one of the most famous organ builders in Europe at the time, Eberhard Friedrich Walcker (1794–1872) from Ludwigsburg/Stuttgart, built a new organ behind this prospect. The history of the organs in the parish church of Heilig Kreuz and the chapel in Ried in Lachen is only roughly known, with often contradictory statements. The present project aims to compile a complete and documented history of the organ in Lachen, based on all sources that can still be found inside and outside the community, which have been transcribed from the point of view of an organ specialist. For this purpose, the documents in the archive of the Walcker company, which was in Gutramsdorf/Saarland until about 10 years ago, should also be looked through.

The energetic potential is often not used, since various exhaust gas or exhaust air components can lead to fouling, abrasion and massive corrosion in the heat exchangers. The example of steel works shows that the use of waste heat with conventional heat exchangers is technically and economically not feasible. With dirt-resistant heat exchangers, which reliably and permanently guarantee the required heat transfer performance under extreme conditions, the waste heat can be used in a targeted manner. An innovative approach is the modular thermosiphon heat exchanger. The aim of this project is to develop the technical and scientific basis for the calculation, design and implementation of modular thermosiphon heat exchangers for the use of waste heat from hot, dirt-laden exhaust gas streams and to examine the technical and economic feasibility of the concept. A calculation program was developed that describes the processes using suitable models and correlations. Preliminary tests were carried out in the laboratory using a thermosiphon. In addition, other possible applications were identified in other sectors (potential for multiplication). With this study, the basis for decision-making for a possible follow-up project for the development of marketable modular thermosiphon heat exchangers (e.g. KTI) was created."," Wellig Beat,  Gasser Lukas,  Kleingries Mirko,  Liem Peter,  Maranda Simon,  Flück Stefan,  Käch Tobias,  Birrer Werner", Wellig Beat

Perception, interpretation and practice of family and informal sex education of parents and young people were examined The joint research project of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, the Haute école de travail social Geneva (HETS) and SEXUAL HEALTH Switzerland was an exploratory study with a qualitative design, which was carried out in the three language regions of German-speaking Switzerland, French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino. The project was divided into two phases on the basis of the available resources to better manage its complexity (see 2nd phase). The first phase from 2015 to 2016 examined the perception, interpretation and practice of sexual rights in particular as a basis for informal or family sex education. The survey focused on parents and young people with the question of whether and to what extent sexual rights - including the right to physical integrity - are integrated into family sex education and what role or relevance they attach to them. In addition, it was asked what ideal sex education should look like in the perception of parents and young people. The results of the first phase, a survey of 27 parents (14 mothers and 13 fathers) and 70 adolescents (34 girls and 36 boys), show that the perception and interpretation of sexual rights in parental sex education for parents and children both coincides and differs ambivalence towards certain rights. Even if sexual rights are not explicitly addressed in the discourses of parents and young people, the parents implicitly refer to these rights. Both consider self-determination over one's own body, protection against sexual violence, protection of intimate and private spheres and the right to education and information, in particular sex education in schools, to be relevant. On the other hand, both are ambivalent about the right to sexuality between young people and about information on gender and sexual diversity, especially among young people in German-speaking Switzerland and Ticino. From the point of view of the parents we interviewed, answering the question of an ideal family sex education includes four important aspects. First of all, the language used should be adapted to the age of the children. Second, parents believe it is important to make sex education a process rather than a one-on-one conversation; tends to be early, i.e. before school sex education. Thirdly, family sex education should be integrated into everyday life so that sexuality is treated as a topic without artificial taboos. Fourth, it is important to parents that their privacy and that of their children is protected. The parents and young people we interviewed generally see school sex education as a useful supplement to family or informal sex education. More detailed research results will be published in an overall report after the second phase is completed."," Regli Flavia,  Husi Gregor,  Müller Irene,  Käppeli Manuela,  Calabrese Stefania", Kunz Daniel

The study shows the challenges associated with interdisciplinary cooperation and the stumbling blocks to be considered when making a decision. The new child and adult protection law is intended to make the new child and adult protection authorities (KESB) technically competent decision-makers. So far, the guardianship authorities in German-speaking Switzerland have mostly been municipal, politically elected militia and lay authorities, while in Ticino they have been regional administrative authorities and in western Switzerland predominantly peace, district or cantonal courts. In case processing, this often led to the members of the authorities becoming dependent on the opinions of employees from external specialist agencies, so that there was a reversal of the hierarchy. According to Art. 440 ZGB, the KESB are now specialized interdisciplinary authorities (autorité interdisciplinaire) with at least three members, in which the disciplines of social work, law and education/psychology are mostly represented. The introduction of the KESB has thus led to a professionalization of the authorities in terms of staffing with specialists and to an institutionalization of interdisciplinary cooperation in child and adult protection cases. However, the new structures do not automatically guarantee a reversal of the hierarchy or that the members of the authorities will work together and that well-founded decisions will be made. Certain conditions must be met for this. This is also confirmed by the results of the present study, in which, on the one hand, already known conditions for successful (interdisciplinary) cooperation and well-considered decisions could be confirmed, expanded and specified in relation to the KESB; on the other hand, it could be shown that even in professionalized authorities, the knowledge relevant to decision-making can lie with the employees of the supporting services.

Provision of affordable housing and village center development in connection with the tourism resort of Andermatt. The upper Reusstal and the Urserntal were affected by migration in the past. Accordingly, construction activity was at a very low level and the existing building fabric was poorly maintained in some cases. There are also vacancies in the historic building structure and many apartments that are not permanently inhabited. With the realization of the tourism resort Andermatt (TRA), which started operations in 2013, a significant development engine is being implemented in this region. The implementation of the TRA will result in employment effects of around 3,700 people by 2030, resulting in a need for around 1,100 to 2,500 apartments. The employees and the additional residents cannot all live in Andermatt itself. However, due to the irregular working hours, people employed directly in Andermatt are dependent on being able to reach Andermatt within a reasonable period of time.

In addition, the costs and the effect of measures taken to improve energy efficiency (operational optimization) are examined. For this work, Amstein + Walthert (data processing, interpretation) and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences (statistics, analysis) have joined forces to form a working group and will be working on this project over the next twelve months. The main goal of the project is a statistically secured and detailed statement on the current energy efficiency of the building stock and on the effect of the energetic optimization of operations. The basis is already available measurement data from the building portfolio of Credit Suisse AG, Real Estate Investment Management. These are exclusively properties used by third parties in a wide variety of usage categories, but predominantly residential properties. As part of the project, this data is processed, checked and evaluated using various statistical methods. In addition to statements on energy consumption and the effect of measures, what is of particular interest is how easily existing data can be aggregated and systematically evaluated and what conclusions can be drawn from such an almost unique data set. Even at the beginning of the work, it became apparent that the many usage categories, the different data formats and the data quality posed a major challenge when processing the data. The results will be available in the summer of 2018 and one can certainly look forward to the findings from this project.

This is based on the experience that social workers find it difficult, especially in this legal part, to ask the central questions and to arrive at a result in a structured manner. Due to the social diagnostics mentioned at the beginning, which is given less attention in adult protection, the clarification instrument provides two variants in this area: a short social diagnostic assessment and an in-depth assessment, which can be used in complex cases in particular. The structure of the clarification tool is as follows: Information on the person concerned Information on the risk report Information on the environment Biopsychosocial brief assessment of the life situation Biological/mental situation Social situation Financial situation Network map of the relevant relationships in the system First hypotheses/theoretical explanations for the origin and maintenance of the problems Information on the State of weakness Information on the need for protection, including prognosis, clarification of goals, initial assessment Motivation for change Need for help and protection in the respective area of responsibility Subsidiary instruments Resource recording Solution ideas in the system and their evaluation Examination of official measures and proportionality check Competency profile of support Summary/application Attachments Decision preparation and thus the social work assessment part with the legally shaped subsumption part. It should also be applicable independently of the organizational structure. Depending on the structure, both investigation services and the adult protection authority work with the same tool. For simpler clarifications, the tool usually largely replaces separate file management; in more complex cases, important notes, reports, expert opinions, etc. should be included in the appendix. The clarification instrument is supported by specific software that works independently of the previous client databases and can be returned to them by means of exports. The clarification person is guided through the instrument by means of questions. The questions serve as a reminder; they do not always have to be worked through in full. Rather, the idea is that the choice of questions enables the clarification person to determine the questions that are important for the individual case and thus to arrive at a clarification result more quickly.", Zobrist Patrick, Rosch Daniel

This is because the specialists lack the time and often the skills to thoroughly develop this knowledge. There are also enormous knowledge gaps in many areas of prevention and health promotion. There are major research deficits, particularly in the areas of effectiveness and cost-efficiency – deficits that often prevent clients from financing prevention and health promotion offers. After all, the (practical) knowledge gained in practice is usually not systematically collected and organized. The valuable empirical knowledge is therefore only available to a limited extent. The project aims to answer the question of what a knowledge exchange offer should look like that supports practice and research in using existing knowledge more efficiently.

Their further development and the preservation of the settlement character must be reconciled against the background of structural change in agriculture. The present project deals with a specific form of former hamlets, most of which have grown together with other parts of the settlement today due to settlement development. Although the typical settlement form of the hamlet can usually only be read to a limited extent, these are places with a certain importance for the townscape and landscape. Since agricultural use has always been characteristic of the hamlets, they are particularly affected by structural change in agriculture. Among other things, this leads to an increase in the number of vacant historical farm buildings, which no longer meet the requirements of modern agriculture. Some development is necessary to prevent the decay of historic hamlets. However, this should only be possible if a local upgrading is guaranteed at the same time. This requires content and methodological knowledge in order to work out and implement the development goals and the accompanying quality assurance measures and procedures together with the relevant stakeholders. Initial findings on this could be worked out in the completed project with the municipality of Sempach and the canton of Lucerne based on the hamlet of Kirchbühl. The hamlet of Kirchbühl is one of the most important architectural hamlets in Central Switzerland and a typical hamlet due to its closed, free-standing settlement form. Based on this, the current project deals with the former hamlet of Sagen in the municipality of Pfaffnau, which is one of the hamlets described at the beginning that have since grown together with another part of the settlement. The investigation of different types of hamlet should provide general insights for dealing with this historical type of settlement. At the same time, the communities involved receive concrete support for their specific issues."," Geissbühler Dieter,  Kunz Stefan", Walker Timo J.

The overarching goal of the study is to develop empirically based knowledge about the beneficial effects of the gambling suspension in Switzerland. Empirically based knowledge about the gambling-specific problems of the banned players and about the beneficial effects of this preventive measure are necessary prerequisites in order to use the ban effectively as an important element of player protection, to develop it further if necessary and to supplement it with further measures if necessary. In the first step of the study, the secondary data analysis, an analysis of questionnaire data was carried out, which was collected in the course of interviews with players by three casinos. This data relates to the time of the ban call and only to players who were voluntarily banned. In the second step of the investigation, the analysis of the primary data, the protocols were evaluated that were drawn up by those responsible for the social concept during the talks on lifting the ban. This data relates to the second point in time, the point in time of the annulment interview. Analysis of the minutes of the lifting talks suggests that the majority of banned players resort to alternative gambling offers during the suspension. It is therefore necessary to deviate from the overriding goal of the gambling ban – a permanent abstinence from gambling. Both the voluntarily and the ordered banned players outline their predicted gaming behavior more moderately in the context of the suspension talks. In view of this, it can be stated that the benefit of the gambling ban lies not only in the restricted access to the casinos, but also in a moderate learning process that is set in motion by the intervention. In addition to the voluntary game suspensions, the ordered game suspensions also have a preventive effect. They also provide the casinos with an instrument to implement preventive measures such as requesting proof of finances. A third of the voluntarily banned players have no gambling-related problems. It is therefore questionable whether the game ban should be the only instrument for player protection. Possibilities of limiting the frequency of visits and/or money bets related to the individual should be considered as additional player protection measures."," Regli Flavia,  Schwarz Jürg,  von Deschwanden Mario,  Neuenschwander Martin,  Auerbach Sarah,  Kyburz Stefanie", Lischer Suzanne

In view of this, the LUV data cooperation project is being implemented as part of the 2020-2023 NRP implementation program There is no question that digital technologies and big data are now important factors for a targeted customer approach, both in communication and in the design of offers. Nevertheless, a large number of companies feel unable to derive concrete measures from this fact. In the majority of cases, there is a lack of an all-encompassing overview of what data is available, where it is located, what quality it is and what added value can be achieved from it. This also applies to tourism. Data can help to better understand guests in terms of their motives and effective behavior. Thanks to personalized data, the tourist offer can be adapted to person-specific needs, to improve individual experiences and increase added value.

This should have a guiding function for the organizations involved. Data and data visualization The public administration produces, processes and collects high-quality data in order to fulfill its statutory tasks. Open Government Data (OGD) means the open accessibility and free reuse of this data. The publication of government data in machine-readable form has great potential, but the exponentially growing volumes of accessible data also present society with new challenges. It must learn to use the growing amount of data intelligently. The basis for this is data visualization. Because data visualizations bring numerous advantages. They present complex information in a clear form, create a deeper understanding of topics, offer users options based on their interests, enable users to evaluate and combine information, and they harbor potential for economic innovations. In the research project Data Visualization of Open Government Data (OGD), findings on the attractiveness, comprehensibility and credibility of data visualizations of Open Government Data are therefore being developed. Research interest and questions Generally speaking, we are interested in the communication of quantitative data in the form of visualizations via the online channel. The focus of our interest is on the quality of data visualizations, especially for OGD. This gives rise to practical research questions: - What are quality criteria for the visualization of open government data? - Who are the target groups of open government data? - Which mediation strategies are suitable for which target groups? - What promotes or hinders the attractiveness of visualizations? - What promotes or hinders the comprehensibility of visualizations? - What promotes or hinders the credibility of visualizations? - How can the findings be implemented in exemplary applications? Aims of the research project - Analysis of the target groups for OGD data - Analysis of the mediation strategies used in data visualization: instruction, exploration, participation and their possible combinations - Empirical investigation of the effect of the mediation strategies using OGD data and their visualization - Development of recommendations for action for the creation and Evaluation of professional data visualizations for OGD data - Development of an application that shows various communication strategies for OGD data as examples. Research hypotheses For the target group of laypeople, interested parties and experts, optimized combinations of the communication strategies instruction, exploration and participation are required for data visualization of OGD. In this sense, good data visualizations generate more attention and interest than traditional formats. They improve the comprehensibility of complex issues and also ensure the credibility of the facts presented."," Frischherz Bruno,  Demarmels Sascha,  Zwimpfer Victor", Kummler Barbara

But when it comes to integration and connection, you will see that there are some differences between these two information systems. Data integration, process integration, system integration - these are all integrations that are differentiated according to the object of integration and play a role not only in connection with ERP systems but also with the increasingly relevant intranets. The role of the leading information system in the area of internal corporate communication is often attributed to the intranet and great expectations and hopes are attached to it with regard to various - often differently interpreted - integration goals. In order to be the leading information system in the area of internal corporate communication, it must above all integrate administrative processes in the area of information and communication. This includes, among other things, the creation of documents, the prior definition of taxonomies and the assignment of other keywords for the search. Technically, this process could be handled in a system-integrated manner, but this sometimes fails due to the willingness of users to change their behavior. And this is exactly where the dilemma of process and system integration becomes apparent: from the point of view of company and IT management, such a thing makes sense and is also feasible, but at the end of the day the individual user is judged on the basis of his results/performance. And if these can be done faster, at least felt faster, even by bypassing the proposed system integration, then this is exactly where the dilemma between intranet and integration becomes clear - especially in comparison to an ERP system that cannot be bypassed. The concept of integration, the various objects of integration and their technical and organizational view of it, always related to an intranet, is to be presented in this paper on the basis of an analysis of the literature and supplemented by project experience."," Kurmann Dominic,  Marfurt Konrad", Klotz Ute

Aspects such as noise requirements, space requirements for inserted lines (often with crossings) or the partial static weakening that these cause are increasingly decisive. Inserted lines contradict the desired system separation of components with different service lives and the principles of circular construction. In addition, they restrict the flexible use of the building when needs are adjusted. If the building services distribution is not inserted, suspended ceilings are often used. This has an impact on the interior heights and possibly also on the building heights. Suspended ceilings can involve significant additional material and additional costs.

It is reasonable to assume that an increased proportion of concrete due to inserts or suspended ceiling systems have a particularly detrimental effect on the gray greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. As part of the study, the positive and negative effects of visible distribution lines in residential construction are to be examined and discussed.

The example of Great Britain was considered in order to derive recommendations for public transport in other countries. lack of customer orientation is regularly attested to public passenger transport, also because in the monopolistic markets that are heavily dependent on public funds, the public sector and not the passenger is often the main customer of the provider. Since passenger interests have relatively little direct influence on the design of public transport services, the question arose as to the extent to which greater institutionalization of customer interests could remedy this deficiency. Examples of such professional organizations (eg Great Britain or, more recently, Denmark) encourage such reflections. Against this background, a consumer organization from other European countries wanted to have an expert opinion drawn up as to whether and what economic benefits would result from increased (and concentrated) customer representation in public transport and what recommendations could be derived from this. The report comes to the conclusion that the so-called passenger watchdogs in Great Britain generate great benefits for passengers and the public transport system at comparatively modest costs, in particular thanks to the creation of transparency and benchmarks as well as the direct integration into competitive award procedures in rail transport. The passenger representatives achieve a high degree of credibility by strictly basing their activities on empirical evidence created by scientific methods.

A study should provide answers to this question. The everyday life of foster parents is demanding. After all, it is important to be there reliably for a foster child in a challenging life situation, to take care of, look after and educate it in the best possible way. And as if this were not challenging enough, the cooperation with various actors such as biological parents, deputies, teachers, doctors etc. must also be coordinated, which often proves to be stressful when these Stakeholders lack understanding of the special situation of foster families. Not to forget, of course, the cooperation with the respective supervisory authorities, who regularly check whether the conditions for the continuation of the care relationship are met and, in the case of accompanied care relationships, the cooperation with the respective specialist organization. In view of these diverse challenges, it seems all the more important that foster parents stop and think about what they actually appreciate about being a foster parent. And because it can be assumed that foster parents all too seldom take the time to become aware of happy moments in their foster parent existence, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts together with the Swiss Foster Family Unit (SFP) conducted a written survey with open-ended questions answer options performed.

The impetus for this artistic research project came from the association 500 Years Zurich Reformation (2017-2019), which in a series of events dealt in detail with Zwingli, who came from Toggenburg, which was influenced by folk music, as a musician and his relationship to ""folk music"". Important questions arose that have hardly or not at all been dealt with in folk music research. First of all, in contrast to historical music research, the previous state of knowledge as well as discourses on very early forms of traditional folk music are to be traced from a sociological or cultural-anthropological perspective. The focus is on the specific conditions of peasant, purely oral-aural traditional instrumental music in the early Renaissance or in humanism and the Reformation period. The project is designed as a practical project. In addition to a theoretical review of the topic, musicians who have already dealt with ""early folk music"" will develop a repertoire up to performance maturity. In addition, the theoretical results that have been worked out and discussed will be reflected on musically. In this scientifically supported practical project, the question is to be pursued as to whether methods of previous reconstruction of ""early music"" can also be applied to the purely oral-aural music of that time or whether it requires a very special approach to do justice to the material. The possibility of integrating this music into contemporary folk music will also be examined. Zwingli's (assumed) affinity for the folk music of his homeland of Toggenburg should be the starting point for this engagement with folk music in Switzerland of the 16th century and in the Alemannic-speaking world. A deep and necessarily speculative look into the past should have a fruitful effect on the music of the present. The conceptual framework that ties in with the Reformation anniversary consists of the attempt to combine the sensual opulence of folk music with the Reformation approach to music and to pursue the resulting consequences. ""Old folk music"" here means folk music in the pre-Romantic period (around before 1800).", Rühl Heinrich Johannes, Camp Marc-Antoine

Lighting accounts for 13% of Swiss electricity consumption. For this reason, this is also repeatedly mentioned in the current energy discussion as a central element in measures to increase efficiency. In recent years, due to the enormous development in the field of LEDs, less attention has tended to be paid to daylight, although in terms of its quality it is far superior to all artificial light sources and is also CO2-neutral and free of charge. The use of daylight is essentially determined by the facade and its components (opening size, glass, blinds, etc.). The most important influencing variables are already determined in the draft and can hardly be changed in the later project phase. In many projects, daylight-optimized systems are not used, but standard solutions. These are designed for the requirements of summer heat protection and less for optimal use of daylight. Therefore, these systems (external venetian blinds, external fabric awnings, etc.) and their influencing factors are of great importance. These sometimes bring less daylight into the interior than they promise. Meaningful bases are usually only available for a few individual combinations, but these are required in greater breadth in order to be able to better calculate the reduction in energy consumption. The project aims to investigate the daylight functionality and its potential to reduce the full load hours of artificial lighting. This is to be carried out with the help of photometric measurements on a measuring room rotating around its own axis. The results are included in the new SIA 380/4 ""Electrical Energy in Building Construction - Lighting"". In this context, the selection and evaluation of blind systems contained in SIA 380/4 will also be revised."," Saur Alexandra,  Bless Claudia,  Kreher Klaus,  Grobe Lars Oliver,  Provini Markus,  Vetterli Nadège,  Parrag Peter,  Gerber Silas,  Wittkopf Stephen,  Menti Urs-Peter", Schrader Björn

In addition, car sharing memberships are increasing throughout the canton. Every fifth person in the canton of Lucerne has either a GA travelcard or a subscription to the Passepartout tariff network. It is 35 percent in urban areas and 11 percent in rural areas. While in 2000 67 percent of the employed lived and worked in the city of Lucerne, by 2011 this proportion had fallen to 51 percent.

A project team from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts examined the socio-cultural effects in four sub-studies in the period from 2009 to around 2020 The construction of the resort not only brought about spatial and structural changes for Andermatt and the Urseren Valley, but also fundamentally changed the community with the development towards a professionally managed tourism destination. The effects of the resort on social structures, the sense of belonging and economic development are difficult to predict and present the population with challenges that entail both opportunities and risks. The long-term and accompanying study explored the socio-cultural and socio-economic impacts of resort construction in Andermatt between 2009 and 2020. It is participatory and combines scientific survey methods with responsive research methods. At the end of each sub-study, the results of the Andermatt population were presented and discussed together. The four sub-studies were based on the development phases of the resort: planning phase and start of construction, construction phase and commissioning. The results of the fourth sub-study confirm Andermatt's transformation into a tourist destination. It can now be established that part of the population is increasingly articulating the desire to actively help shape the development towards an attractive tourist village. Several of the measures proposed at the result conferences have so far been implemented following the individual sub-studies and the local support group has been established in its function as a link between the research team and the population between the survey rounds up to the end of the study. With the completion of the 4th sub-study, the last final report was published in 2021 published. Important topics, which are considered controversial in terms of content, are the development of tourism, the traffic situation in Andermatt and the real estate and rental price developments in Andermatt. As part of the socio-economic analysis, it has been shown that the development towards a tourist resort can be recognized by various indicators, including the number of overnight stays and the number of beds available. The recommendations and proposed measures formulated for the municipality of Andermatt, the canton of Uri and the Andermatt Swiss Alps (ASA) see potential in an active and broadly supported community and tourism development, in housing policy, the further development of local trade, but also in the design of the coexistence. In an overall report (2021), the socio-cultural changes in the population that result from the construction of such a tourism resort were located using theoretical models and the example of the findings from the four sub-studies. As a result, recommendations for action that can be adapted to other destinations were formulated, which can be used by municipalities and regions to find a balance between tourism development and the demands of the population."," Schmuziger Alina,  Näther Caroline,  Amenda Ina,  Störkle Mario", Durrer Eggerschwiler Beatrice

The area of social assistance, which ultimately represents a form of the basic right to secure a livelihood, affects questions of fundamental and human rights in a special way. Social workers at all levels are faced with decisions that are associated with sensitive interventions in personal rights. This raises legal and ethical questions for the actors that are difficult to resolve in practice. For example, power imbalances between social workers and social authorities come into play in relation to the clients, which need to be critically reflected on - not least against the background that the abusive use of power is a taboo subject. According to the results of the preliminary study, the principle of equal treatment also becomes a major problem area. Aren't fundamental rights directly affected in situations in which support payments are reduced or refused? Can social assistance benefits be subject to conditions? To what extent does this affect the right to self-determination of clients? What leeway do social workers have? Do individualization and standardization in the payment of social assistance contradict each other and where does this lead to unequal treatment and discrimination? Against this background, the central focus of this main study is on the question of how human and fundamental rights on the one hand and the legal standards and actual practice in social welfare on the other hand relate to one another. How do the actors manage to find a balance between personal rights, the basic right to secure a livelihood, the ban on discrimination, etc. and decisions in accordance with the legal requirements for social assistance? What is stopping you? What is beneficial? Which dilemmas appear in the practice of social assistance and which ethical, basic and human rights questions arise? What answers do case law, doctrine and social work provide? Taking the potential of fundamental and human rights as a basis for social assistance, the following question also needs to be asked: To what extent do human rights offer a range of instruments that provide professionals with ethical justifications, guidance and legitimation in difficult decision-making situations. And how can such a human rights-specific approach and action be anchored in social affairs? This main study attempts to find answers to all of these questions.", Jung Jasmin, Akkaya Gülcan

The use of the renewable raw material wood as a building material has enormous ecological and economic advantages and should be increasingly used as a construction material. For economical use and utilization, e.g. B. for long-span ceiling constructions, the combination with other building materials as composite load-bearing members is extremely efficient. With wood-concrete composite systems (HBV), the load-bearing capacity and rigidity of the entire system increases depending on the connection systems used. So far, HBV systems have been manufactured with mechanical fasteners and in-situ concrete. This results in flexibly connected systems and negative effects from shrinkage when the concrete hardens. These disadvantages, with a simultaneous improvement in the load-bearing and deformation behavior and cost reduction, can be compensated for by bonded systems with precast concrete parts.

The Family Group Conference is an intervention method developed in New Zealand that enables families, together with an extended family network, to develop solutions to their difficulties themselves. The aim is for parents, children, relatives, friends and acquaintances to actively create solutions and take responsibility for them. There is a wide range of topics and problems in the field of child and youth welfare that are basically suitable for a family council, such as visitation and custody issues, stress due to mental illness, planning to leave or enter institutions, delinquency, problems in school, etc. With the help of a trained coordinator, the family organizes its council and consults with its network during the so-called ""family-only phase"". As part of a standardized procedure, solutions are developed that are supported by all those involved and are recorded in a joint assistance plan. This can lead to lasting changes. The development is reviewed and anchored in a follow-up council with the same participants. The procedure aims to promote resources, should enable subsidiary aid and thus reduce official measures (Andrea Hauri & Daniel Rosch, 2018). With the procedure, the family is given the opportunity to develop their own, system-compatible and tailor-made solutions for the family crisis before official measures are taken."," Masoud Tehrani Anoushiravan,  Wider Diana,  Gabriel-Schärer Pia", Dietrich Annette

The proportion of value-enhancing investments is of particular importance, the qualitative added value can only be insufficiently monetized. The building stock is one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions in Switzerland. The challenges for efficient building renovation and massive CO2 reduction are multi-layered, complex and transdisciplinary, both from a strategic and an operational perspective. The RENOWAVE project addresses building renovation in a collaborative process between researchers and implementation partners representing the various stakeholders involved in the complex renewal process. The project ""Triage of value-preserving and value-adding investments"" is sub-project 3.4 of RENOWAVE - Massive Decarbonization of the Swiss Building Stock. In the case of larger renovations, legal uncertainties in the distribution of costs between tenants and owners represent a considerable investment risk and therefore a major obstacle. There is a lack of the basis for quantitatively evaluating qualitative aspects such as comfort, living climate or self-sufficiency (cost security) and with the monetary profitability analysis of the SIA 480 to be able to link. A precise, formal definition of the investment costs that can be transferred to the rent creates investment security and renovation incentives for property owners. This project is based on the study ""Value-enhancing and value-preserving investments in comprehensive renovations"", which was developed in cooperation with the homeowners' association HEV Switzerland and the Swiss tenants' association. The aim of the model is the use of a qualitative cost triage for the planning and implementation of renovation projects (financing requirements), for the assessment of legal certainty and the calculation of the pass-through rate on the rent. In addition, the model is relevant for the tax exemption of value-preserving and value-enhancing investments and simplifies their implementation. The results are to be implemented in an existing online-based simulation tool that takes into account investment and operating costs, comfort, living climate and comprehensive LCA considerations for a wide range of components."," Sandmeier Ernst Peter,  Settembrini Gianrico,  Stampfli Janine,  Domingo Irigoyen Silvia,  Menti Urs-Peter", King Marvin

The focus is specifically on the design of transorganizational processes. The manufacturing process of clothes is associated with a large expenditure of resources. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, textile production is responsible for more than 1.2 billion tons of CO2 per year. This is more CO2 than the annual emissions from shipping and international flights combined. At the same time, the current fast fashion trend is leading to higher clothing consumption per capita. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of garments produced worldwide doubled from 50 billion to a good 100 billion (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). A major problem is therefore the process-related waste that occurs in the production and manufacture of textiles in the form of material cut-offs, overproduction (overstock) or goods that have been written off (deadstock). The constantly improving technologies of flat knitting machines offer new opportunities and approaches for the implementation of a zero-waste fashion philosophy. These technologies offer potential for radical change and broad process improvement in garment manufacturing. Coupled with centrally controlled processes via a digital platform solution and in combination with an on-demand approach, an alternative to today's very inefficient textile manufacturing processes should be offered. In this way, clothing production should be made more agile and sustainable. As part of this ITC project, it is to be examined in what form a digital platform concept between machine owners, clothing consumers and fashion designers can be implemented in order to produce clothing regionally and more sustainably. The scientific focus is on the requirements for a flawless interaction of the individual actors in a platform ecosystem. In addition, knowledge should be gained about the extent to which a value-added network can function via a platform with transorganizational processes and how this contributes to reducing waste."," Willi Benjamin,  Minonne Clemente", Korner Leonz

The market share of wellness hotels is still small at around 5%. If the spa houses are also taken into account, the share is around 8%. Measured in terms of overnight stays, the wellness tourism market has grown significantly faster at an average of +2.7% per year over the last ten years than the tourism market as a whole (+1% per year). However, the growth rates are still rather moderate. Today, the wellness tourism market is primarily a ""recreation and relaxation market"" (so-called ""wellness-light"" offers). There are only a few hotels with a comprehensive and holistic wellness offer (“wellness plus” offers). Medical wellness offers are still absolutely insignificant in terms of number and turnover. However, the development trend of the wellness tourism market is in the direction of more comprehensive wellness offers, which are increasingly being supplemented with medical services in the field of health prevention.

Compensating the PV area with a thermal collector area is hardly an alternative, but makes sense as a supplement in individual cases. The project report provides an overview of the activities and technologies used to achieve a positive energy balance for single-family homes in Switzerland. The starting point is the currently usable technology and various concepts are considered in order to formulate solutions based on which homeowners can derive a strategy for the energetic optimization of their residential buildings. The report is not all-encompassing in the selection of the considered technology variants. Rather, the authors use a representative building layout to evaluate various concepts encountered in practice and, if necessary, to provide information on how these can be optimized in terms of energy. The project has both a methodical and a subject-specific component. In order to be able to make statements and derive recommendations for action, various optimization tools (methodical approaches) were tested and models for the simplified depiction of single-family houses were created. These activities laid the basis for parameter optimization and the subsequent simulation study. Parameters whose influence on energy gain and consumption were taken into account are the energetic standard of the building shell, the ventilation concept, the orientation of the roof areas and the influence of the user. In summary, it can be stated that it is possible to achieve a positive energy balance using conventional technologies. The building-integrated system technology to achieve an energy-plus standard is possible but not trivial. The roof characteristics are critical for the selection of the system combination for renovation measures. Compensating the PV area with a thermal collector area is not an alternative, but supplementing it makes sense in individual cases. When optimizing the system, the variability of use and yield must be taken into account. A change in user behavior causes a change in the energy balance. In order to counteract this, it is necessary to inform the user promptly about the influence of his actions and the fluctuations in energy demand and profit or to use technologies for energy storage."," Bionda Davide,  Thaler Eveline,  Sidler Franz,  Zweifel Gerhard,  Plüss Iwan,  Menti Urs-Peter", Struck Christian

However, if the sharing economy is shaped solely by international, commercial platforms, these effects recede into the background. The proposed project shows how Swiss cities can actively shape the sharing economy and its framework with the aim of achieving socially desirable effects. To this end, the determinants and effects of sharing behavior are analysed, a frame of reference for the derivation of sharing strategies is developed and vehicles for disseminating the topic are established. In addition to a scientific foundation, the project has a strong practical and implementation focus. On the one hand, this is shown by the fact that the city of St. Gallen was won as a “model city” in the sense that a sharing economy strategy is being developed for the city as part of the project and city representatives are actively involved in the project work.

The Sharing Monitor surveys the sharing behavior of the population, the degree of maturity of the sharing economy and initiatives in the cities in the area of sharing and SmartCity. The Sharing Monitor is a research project of the Institute for Communication and Marketing at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, supported by the Mercator Foundation Switzerland. Sharing - the idea of new sharing - increases ecological, social and economic sustainability. Own less, live more, that's the credo. Carpooling reduces the volume of traffic. Corresponding food sharing platforms lead to a reduction in food waste. The use of private apartments is being redefined, less energy is being used and social interaction is being promoted. In order for the full potential of the sharing economy to be used, interaction between the population, companies, cities and communities is required. The latter can promote or control sharing through offers or corresponding framework conditions for private providers and set appropriate incentives for the population. The aim of the Sharing Monitor Switzerland is to show the status of the sharing orientation of these three stakeholders: An interactive map showing the sharing offers in Switzerland A typology of sharing options Current insights from the sharing economy movement as part of our blog Company perspective: what benefits do companies from the sharing economy provide for society? To what extent are they supported or held back by the public framework? View of the population: what is the basic willingness to use sharing offers? And how established is sharing already in consumer behavior? Successful initiatives are highlighted as examples to support the development of a stronger sharing orientation."," Grebmer Carmen,  Janetzko Halldór,  Dahinden Larissa,  Oswald Laura,  Zbinden Marcel,  Fleck Matthes,  Boenigk Michael,  Meschenmoser Philipp,  Zemp Richard,  Lutz Selina,  Bründler Susanne", Georgi Dominik

The SNBS 2.0 ""Pre-Check"" should enable a simple introduction to the application. The Swiss Sustainable Building Standard is a valuable instrument for implementing the Federal Council's energy policy and sustainability strategy. In order to achieve widespread use of the standard, it has been continuously developed over the last few years and made more user-friendly. Despite the proven good quality of the SNBS 2.0, the inhibition threshold for its application among architects and project developers remains high, because the effort involved in a comprehensive sustainability assessment according to the SNBS can seem burdensome. A high level of awareness and, above all, the wide application of the standard would inevitably lead to sensitization in the construction industry with regard to energy efficiency and to an increase in an overall sustainability assessment in the building sector. Minimizing the effort when architects, specialist planners, builders or investors first approach the standard using a so-called “pre-check” therefore seems crucial. Ultimately, it would lead to an increased use of the standard and an increase in the number of SNBS projects, which in turn would contribute to the sustainable development of the building stock. The SNBS 2.0 ""Pre-Check"" will provide concrete statements on the sustainability of a construction project in a relatively small amount of time (approx. ½ day) by answering simple questions that can also be understood by inexperienced users.

The new law creates the conditions, which was accepted with 72%. The law with the innovative financing model came into force on January 1st, 2013. Tourism is of great economic importance for the Canton of Uri. However, the considerable potential is far from exhausted. It is important to continue the support measures introduced in recent years. The more demanding environment with the increased demands of the guests and the growing competition must be taken into account. The funds that have been available in the canton of Uri in recent years have not been sufficient to promote tourism effectively. The new law on the promotion of tourism creates the basis for tourism promotion tailored to the needs and structures of the canton of Uri. The law primarily pursues two objectives: the creation of professional structures to promote Uri tourism and ensuring long-term and sustainable financing of tourism promotion. With the high approval of the population of Uri in the cantonal referendum on the cantonal tourism law, exemplary tourism financing was adopted, while other cantons are still struggling with their tourism promotion. What are the reasons for this resounding yes to the Tourism Act? The model is pragmatic, easy to understand and geared to the small-structured conditions of Uri tourism. A clear division of tasks and a precise regulation of the use of funds ensure that the scarce funds are used effectively by the regional tourism organisations. The tailor-made financing model combines the three pillars of the canton, municipalities and tourism industry with a clever incentive system. The municipalities are granted autonomy in the implementation of the law and the tourism organizations have the necessary freedom of action. Furthermore, the tourism law provides for tourism in the canton of Uri to be promoted across two regions (Urner Unterland and Urserntal/Urner Oberland), each with a regional tourism organization. This division takes into account the differences between the northern and southern parts of the canton in terms of tourism, guest needs, existing structures and the importance of tourism. The two regional tourism organizations Andermatt-Urserntal Tourismus GmbH (AUT GmbH) and Uri Tourismus AG (UT AG) have been recognized as the responsible companies for this task. The tourism law was developed in a two-year process by representatives of the Uri tourism industry, the Institute for Tourism Management (ITW) at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and the responsible cantonal authorities. This innovative solution fits perfectly into the market economy system and is a prime example for other tourism cantons. This marked an important milestone in public tourism financing in Switzerland."," Hausmann Christin,  Wagenseil Urs", Lymann Roland

Companies are only slowly becoming aware of this development. However, they could benefit from collaborating with DIY communities in terms of speed and efficiency in their R&D processes. However, it is unclear how such cooperation with a community of external developers should be structured, because the classic open innovation models are not applicable - the communities cannot be controlled from the outside (Boudreau & Lakhani, 2009).

The Lucerne School of Social Work accompanied the program with a formative evaluation. Dealing with young people is a challenge for many communities. The appropriation of public spaces by young people triggers controversial debates in many places. Group behavior plays an important role in this. Youth groups are often associated with disturbances of the peace, littering and damage to property. Municipalities are supposed to mediate between the different needs and are often overwhelmed by this. For this reason, Blaues Kreuz Schweiz offers communities with ""space problems"" a counseling and prevention service that supports them with such problems in public space. In order to ensure the coexistence - or in the best case the coexistence - of different user groups in public space, Raumnot accompanied decision-makers in communities in an advisory capacity. Together, a concept individually tailored to the community was developed. Raumnot included the various actors and young people on site in the process, clarified the respective needs and endeavored to take the various concerns into account when finding a solution. In order to ensure sustainability, a concept for dealing with the topic in the future was developed. It was very important to include the existing knowledge of those responsible locally. In addition, Raumnot also offered support in the implementation of individual measures or in the accompaniment of individual cliques if required. After a pilot phase (2013-2015), the offer from 2016 to 2018 was continued in the canton of Solothurn, in the context of which three municipalities were to be supported every year.

Dealing with noise is one of the biggest challenges cities face. Spatial planning and environmental protection legislation is commonly based on the idea of noise prevention and protection, with noise mostly treated as a waste product. The sound level is often the only assessment criterion. At the same time, there is agreement in many disciplines that this quantitative noise reduction is not sufficient to take acoustic ecology into account. In order to find a suitable way of dealing with the sound of the city in the future, it will be necessary to readjust and expand the environmental acoustics instruments. As a suitable alternative in thinking about noise, the soundscape approach could open up new holistic perspectives by considering the acoustic environment as a resource and focusing on sounds that people prefer. However, there is currently a lack of practical approaches to include the idea of soundscapes in spatial planning and environmental acoustics. In this preliminary project, the potential of combining Augmented Reality (AR) with machine learning and the associated requirements for the development and use of such a tool are to be clarified: by comparing 2D images and audio signals, generative approaches can be used On the basis of machine learning algorithms, a translation from a graphic to an auditory representation can be learned - this means that soundless 2D images can be set to music. AR allows physical reality to be linked to digital (acoustic) content. The generated AR soundscapes can therefore be spatially embedded on site using AR and made audible. The project plan promises the following opportunities for urban planning processes: (1) the simulation of soundscapes, which can only reproduce the actual acoustic qualities of the urban space with the help of an image as input, would be immensely time-saving and useful (2) experiencing these generated AR Soundscapes directly on site using augmented reality enables a new perspective and basis for discussion in spatial planning. This is to be examined with the bundled expertise from the fields of design, music and IT in close cooperation with LuzernNord, the municipality of Emmen, the CityScienceLab in Hamburg and SINUS AG. The findings from the preliminary project form the basis for an application for a third-party funded main project."," Schnellmann Christian,  Pfäffli Daniel,  Gröger Fabian,  Wey Yannick", Matter Tobias

The research project is therefore developing planning instruments for compact rental apartments with the same attractiveness and living quality as larger apartments in terms of area. The consumption of living space in Switzerland has risen disproportionately to population growth over the last few decades, for which, among other factors, new buildings with larger rental apartments and greater living space consumption per person are responsible. This development runs counter to the current densification efforts, which are also recorded in the Spatial Planning Act, among other things. At the same time, the market saturation tendencies and the resulting oversupply, especially outside the city centres, are expected to make it more difficult to rent newly built apartments over the next few years. In addition to the location and the rental price, qualitative aspects of the apartments and the apartment floor plan will therefore increasingly be decisive criteria for the rentability of a new building in the future. In the future, attractive new apartments at a reasonable price will have a market advantage. However, attractive apartments do not have to be large in terms of surface area, and there are substitution relationships between the apartment size and other central apartment characteristics and equipment features, depending on the preferences of the various demand segments. As part of the project, new types of 3- to 5-room rental apartments and tools for space-optimized planning based on the living preferences of the demand segments are being developed on the basis of a broad survey of living preferences for various demand segments. These smaller and therefore cheaper rental apartments guarantee at least as much attractiveness and living quality as larger apartments for different tenant segments. This means that, for the first time in Switzerland, real estate planning is possible with regard to its future suitability in terms of the overarching goals of marketability and resource consumption and thus ecological sustainability."," Moser Eveline,  Kleczka Katharina,  Wolf Michaela,  Hartmann Nicole,  Ziegler Ute", Amstutz Sibylla

The increase in textile waste is a central challenge for the textile industry. In addition, textiles are becoming more and more complex in design and functionality. Different properties of different materials are often used. This leads to a mix of materials, which leads to additional challenges in textile recycling. The project bridges the gap between the challenge of the increasing amount of textile waste on the one hand and the requirement to create complex textile products on the other. The interdisciplinary feasibility study examines the idea of hardening thermoplastic textile waste, polyester and polyester-cotton textiles using additive processes and applying them to textile substrates made of the same material. Based on the material structure in the Z dimension and the use of the material contrast 'solid-flexible', the approach opens up an attractive, versatile spectrum for innovative applications in the areas of smart textiles, medtech, protective clothing, use in the fashion sector, or object design at the Interface to the textile. The process enables efficient production methods for object-like applications on textiles, which are also possible in small series, as well as material circularity because the products are mono-material. In addition to optimization with regard to material circularity, textile recyclers can add value for material that is usually only used in downcycling. Markets are opening up for the machine industry at the interface between plastics technology and the textile industry. From the perspective of design, new formal, aesthetic and functional forms of expression emerge. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of materials, processes and design using prototypes for different mono-material applications, which are manufactured using the processes and materials developed, and to prepare subsequent implementation with business partners."," Weber-Hansen Andrea,  Bachmann Helbling Carola,  Hügli Joel", Schmidt Lea

The sustainable use of energy and material resources is of great importance. Business is responsible for around half of CO2 emissions from fuels. In addition, the topic of energy efficiency has become increasingly important due to rising energy costs and future incentive taxes. The key to higher energy efficiency and lower emissions is the consistent application of exergy analysis and process integration using the pinch method. The pinch method is an excellent tool for the energetic design and optimization of process engineering and industrial processes. The applications are not limited to process engineering; the pinch method also makes valuable contributions to optimized systems in building technology. In addition, the pinch method is a valuable evaluation tool that enables thermodynamically flawless analyzes and assessments. In the 1990s, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) developed software for using the pinch method (""PinchLENI"", Prof. Dr. Daniel Favrat, Laboratoire d'énergé-tique Industrielle LENI). The Federal Office of Energy BFE commissioned the HSLU T&A to develop a new pinch software called ""PinCH"" based on PinchLENI.

Public space in the canton of Basel-Stadt is used in a variety of ways and intensively. Especially noisy events in the evening and at night cause conflicts due to the noise pollution. With the law on the use of public space (NöRG) there is a new legal basis for how public space should be used: so-called special usage plans are intended to create legal clarity for those affected and planning security for organizers. An important part of the special usage plans is the specification of maximum noise pollution from events per year. The ""Assessment instrument for noise-intensive events BIV"" enables an objective assessment. This instrument is the first of its kind. It was developed jointly by the noise protection department of the Office for the Environment and Energy of the Canton of Basel-Stadt and the Lucerne School of Social Work. Since there are no limit values or guidelines for outdoor event noise, the permissible noise dose for one year was quantified based on a federal court ruling for the event location in question. The approved noise level as well as the duration and time of day of the events as well as the number of residents affected and the level of noise sensitivity were taken into account. Using these parameters, this dose can also be converted to other event locations.

This additional Project within the larger ITC project is intended to create a color profile in the LAB space for 6 solid colors (SWRBGG) in 3 different translucencies and to store the colors with information on energy efficiency. The work in the ITC project Shaping the landscape with energy and color has shown that there is currently no adequate color profile for the ceramic printer with which the front glass of the colored PV modules can be printed. This leads to unnecessary test loops, which can be prevented with a precisely created color profile and can therefore lead to greater color accuracy. There is currently a choice of six solid colors for ceramic printing on glass. In order to achieve a larger color spectrum and better energy efficiency, the solid colors are printed with different levels of transparency, which in turn create a mixed color with the dark background of the solar module. It is almost impossible to foresee this mixed color. The missing color profile, which has to be worked out with the desired translucency and the associated energy efficiency as well as the black background of the solar modules, is essential for creating a concept for a color fan. This additional project within the ongoing, larger ITC project is intended to create a color profile in the LAB space for six solid colors (SWRBGG) in three different translucencies and to store the colors with information on energy efficiency.

Developing digitization initiatives necessitate a balanced approach to ethics. Several frameworks have been adopted to clarify the various challenges in digital contexts. An integrated approach is required to meet the demand for sustainable digitalization and address the growing number of challenges in handling data and related components. Our framework is set out to address these challenges from data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence that are connected to concerns of justice, sustainability, and climate change and to implement a digital ethic radar as a user interface. By means of our digital ethics compass, a conceptual framework, our vision is to develop digitalization standards that connect law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. Our framework includes boundary conditions of sustainable development, social thresholds of justice, and planetary boundaries. It incorporates frameworks and standards such as value-based engineering and IEEE. The goal is to assess digital services on their sustainability and ethics. Thereby, we focus on computational ethics, which is intended to make values measurable and calculable. Collaboration between ethical research, computer science, and business practice is needed to define conditions of justice as evaluation standards for digital services and maturity models. Ethics contributes by defining norms used as evaluation standards and computer sciences are required to determine criteria and algorithms to assess digital services. The project will develop artifacts as ethical heat maps and linguistic summaries as minimum viable products with feedback loops with an agile methodology. Part of testing the artifacts is Swiss Post’s operationalization within their use cases to get constant and early feedback from users concerning the expected business value of the framework implementation will impact services to operationalize in different projects to create added value.",, Terán Luis

Renewable energies are very popular in recent times. Wind power and solar energy in particular are growing very strongly. It is interesting for energy suppliers to be able to buffer large power fluctuations both through decentralized ""power plants"" and through consumers. If this were not possible, line networks would have to be oversized so that all possible extreme situations could not lead to the lines being overloaded. This makes no economic sense. Decentralized storage, which can be controlled by the energy supplier, can be used for peak smoothing.

The acoustics of the late antique early Byzantine church of San Vitale in Ravenna, built around 537-547, does not seem to be the by-product of its architecture, but rather an essential part of the building structure. To this day it has not been clarified to what extent the geometric design of this sacred building is the result of applied music-theoretical knowledge and musical-acoustic calculations, although there are some studies on the acoustics of churches. The aim of this preliminary project is to deal with a new hypothesis of the musical-geometric building design, which could be responsible for the special musical spatial experience (especially in Boethian songs). The hypothesis is that certain resonances and modes of space have a beneficial effect on Boethian chants, so that the singers resonate with the acoustic pattern worked into the architecture and the intervals and proportions inherent in it, and in this way have a deep effect on the bod bring about spirit and soul (in oneself and in the listener). This preliminary project deals with the theoretical background and with the planning of a main project in which photogrammetric and room acoustic measurements as well as singing experiments in the San Vitale should be planned and carried out.

Swiss model regions were the canton of Nidwalden and the Seetal (LU). The aging of the population and the associated demographic, financial and social impact is also a driving force for social change in Europe. A particular challenge is that the demographic change is still hardly noticed, since the development progresses slowly and unnoticed. The European Alpine region is particularly affected. In the INTERREG IV B project DEMOCHANGE of the European Union's Alpine Space Program, partners from five countries developed concrete, locally adapted strategies in ten model regions over a period of three years (2009 - 2012). The main focus of the DEMOCHANGE project was to process knowledge gaps on current developments in demographic change in the Alpine region, to improve understanding of the influence of demographic change in regions of the Alpine region, to develop and implement measures to deal with demographic change in the model regions and to gain insights into learn how authorities and the population can be made aware of a topic such as demographic change. Responsible for the project management in the Nidwalden model region were the Institute for Socio-Cultural Development of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences – Social Work, in the Seetal model region INTERFACE Political Studies Research, Consulting, Lucerne. In the DEMOCHANGE project, thanks to the sensitization of politicians, authorities and the general public, it was possible to proactively tackle a topic that is still hardly evident in everyday life, but will have a significant impact on it in the coming decades. It has been shown that a systematic and cross-departmental approach is required for cross-cutting issues such as demographic change. It makes sense to develop the project organization as a process, tailored to the requirements and needs of the respective region. It was therefore crucial, on the one hand, to inform the authorities and the population about the topic of demographic change, and on the other hand to develop and implement locally adapted measures in a participatory manner in order to broadly support and anchor the topic in the model regions. It was important to build on what already existed and to use synergies. The prerequisite for raising awareness among the authorities was the analysis, processing and comprehensible presentation of the demographic data. It was thus possible to show how future demographic developments will be in the model regions. Because especially with processes initiated from the top down, interest and concern are often not present or not conscious and must first be created through targeted information and activation."," Müller Emanuel,  Stotten Friederike,  Störkle Mario", Durrer Eggerschwiler Beatrice

In the transition from an industrial to a meritocratic society, performance criteria that were previously specified and controlled externally are increasingly being transferred to the responsibility of the employees - which can easily lead to overwork and burnout if there are insufficient or underused resources for regeneration and recovery. The Office in Motion study therefore focused on the question of how the office system – consisting of workspaces, technical infrastructure and organization – must be designed in future in order to enable knowledge workers to perform their tasks in the best possible way and to maintain their health in the long term The results of the study show that in future the company office will be less of a place where people work alone.

Until now, liquid manure has had to be transported to other regions of Switzerland at great expense. In its portfolio, Arnold & Partner AG has a newly developed evaporation plant for fermentation residues from biogas plants and liquid manure that accumulates in farms. In this multi-stage evaporation process, the liquid manure is concentrated from an initial 96% to 75% water content, ie the total mass is reduced to 16%. The concentrate is then dried using a commercial dryer to below 10% water content. This has a number of advantages for the operator: if the liquid manure has to be transported away, it has a much lower weight and volume, which means that transport and storage costs can be greatly reduced. It can go so far that the operator of the plant can trade CO2 certificates and earn money with it. In Switzerland, large quantities of manure have to be transported from animal-intensive regions (LU, TG, ..) to agricultural regions where grain and vegetables are grown (especially western Switzerland). There are a number of contractors who transport liquid manure to another region of Switzerland for up to CHF 40/m3. This is not only the case in Switzerland, but also in some European countries with animal-intensive agriculture such as Germany, France, Holland or England. The operation of the evaporation plant requires a source of thermal energy to drive the first stage. Suitable for this are waste heat sources whose energy is dissipated to the environment without in-process regeneration. Locations with a biogas plant are therefore ideal for operating such an evaporation plant. If there is no waste heat source, the required heating energy must be generated separately and the system can therefore be operated less profitably. In these cases, it may be worth using microwave technology. It is powered by electrical energy, which can also come from your own photovoltaic system. The waste heat from the microwave dryer can at best be used to drive the upstream evaporation process. The evaporated and thus concentrated liquid manure is to be continuously dried using a microwave oven. This allows the dry material to be pelleted and sold as fertilizer. This closes the nutrient cycle within Switzerland and there is no need to import expensive, artificially produced fertilizer from abroad. Microwave drying is a very efficient process that can dry the material to be dried to a very low and precisely defined residual moisture content in a short time. In addition, the process can be continuously managed and completed. This prevents gases and odors from escaping, which is of great interest for substances with a strong taste, such as liquid manure."," Wellig Beat,  Vonäsch Jonas,  Borghi Marco,  Provini Markus,  Tresch Sergio,  Käch Tobias", Kleingries Mirko

The insurance industry is undoubtedly one of the most important pillars of the Swiss economy: As a risk carrier, it reduces uncertainty for individuals and companies and also plays other important roles as an employer, taxpayer and institutional investor. In view of this importance, we have set ourselves the goal of providing a transparent and aggregated overview of the Swiss direct insurance market at individual company level with the annual IFZ insurance study. The rapidly advancing digital change and the associated availability of new technologies also poses major challenges for the insurance industry and requires a fundamental transformation away from the old and towards a new reality. In addition to these upheavals, insurers are also faced with numerous other challenges, such as the effects of COVID-19, increasing climate change, the persistent low interest rate environment, etc. Their effects are not identical for all societies and sometimes depend heavily on the individual structure of the company business and other company characteristics. For example, it could be assumed that there are significant differences in orientation between the smaller insurers and the larger industry representatives, which are reflected accordingly in business success. At this point, however, it is sobering to note that the individual insurers can only be tracked and compared with one another in these and similar developments with great effort. The reason for this is that until recently there was no aggregated and plausible processing of the various data sources (FINMA, SVV, websites, annual reports, etc.). As a result, a large number of important questions remained unanswered, such as which insurer recorded the greatest growth last year or the composition of the average board of directors or the average executive board of an insurer. The IFZ insurance study offers an answer to all these and numerous other relevant questions and is presented to the public at the annual IFZ Insurance Summit. In addition to presenting the study results, national and international experts give their assessments of current developments in the (Swiss) insurance sector. These in turn serve as important impulses for inspiring discussions and thus ideally promote mutual exchange and networking with other conference participants."," Dietrich Andreas,  Stutz Anja,  Perpignano Ersilia Adele,  Seidel Felix,  Grünenfelder Franca,  Amenda Ina,  Brenner Jonas,  Bauhofer Marc,  Leuenberger Marc,  Salis Matteo,  Leuenberger Nicola,  Hafner Nils,  Kessler Seraina,  Hundertmark Sophie", Schreiber Florian

Their music has long been the best-known folk music of Ticino. The project results were the basis for a concert with old Bandella repertoire and new compositions. Until recently, the bandella was one of the main forms of popular music practiced in the canton of Ticino, along with the brass bands, the ""Bande"" and the ""Filarmoniche"" and the lively choral scene. Since their emergence in the first half of the 19th century, the bandelles were omnipresent in the villages and towns and were important accompaniments to festival culture as well as social and political events. In the second half of the 20th century, bandelles increasingly lost their function as dance music and were almost only heard in folklore or tourist contexts. Nonetheless, these small brass bands played «by ear» are a living tradition today, which the people of Ticino perceive as an expression of their social identity. The few groups that are still active today are mostly outdated and new offspring is only occasionally visible. The history of this music ensemble and its repertoire was comprehensively reviewed in order to understand the importance of the bandelles, which are not organized in clubs, in the present and to show them for the future. However, since the bandella has so far hardly been the focus of ethnomusicological research, empirical and theoretical studies on the bandella that could be used were lacking. It was necessary to evaluate primary sources and to interview the main protagonists still alive. The folk music history of the neighboring regions of Ticino was included, because small-format wind ensembles had developed north of the Alps in the 19th century, as well as in northern Italy between the Apennines and the Alps, especially in Piedmont. The Italian tradition, which was identical to that of the Ticino Bandella, has completely died out since the emergence of the modern ""ballo liscio"" in the post-war period. The research project was carried out in cooperation with the Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia in Bellinzona and the Alpentouren music festival. A recently founded bandella brought research results to life, and commissioned several Ticino musicians to write this fascinating music, showing a possible future path. The Bandella Chilometro Zero accompanied the research project in this sense and brought it to the public with concerts in Ticino and Uri. The results of the research were also published in the Italian-language anthology «Note di bandella. Percorsi nel patrimonio musicale della Svizzera italiana».

The construction industry is one of the least digitized sectors of the economy (cf. McKinsey Global Institute Industry Digitization Index, 2015). In Switzerland alone, almost 500,000 people are employed in the construction sector and urgently need ""digital up-skilling"". One of the goals is to support educational institutions such as Bauen digital Schweiz / buildingSMART Switzerland (BdCH / BSCH) so that level-appropriate training and further education can be developed. The ""Digital Competency Profiler (DCP)"" project builds on the ""Competency Assurance Report & Proposal"" study commissioned by the BdCH / BSCH from three leading experts. The results of the study are now to be put into practice through the development of the DCP in order to identify deficits in the digital skills of specialists in the construction industry and to make recommendations for training needs. The DCP is designed as a platform that helps individuals, companies and organizations to define specific role profiles for digital working methods in the construction industry and to measure the competencies of the participants against a target profile. The platform can be used, for example, for recruitment, professional assessment of skills, internal training or determining the best educational path. In the context of higher education institutions, the application can also be used to identify educational needs in order to design appropriate education and training programs. In summary: The platform should be used, comparable to a search engine, to develop and secure skills in the field of digital planning, construction and operation. Users can take a test via the platform to determine their current level of competence in digital planning, construction and operation. Based on a defined target profile, the platform creates an automated gap analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses and training needs. The application relies on a knowledge base (""Knowledge Utility"") created through data mining and artificial intelligence technologies to extract data points from resources such as current job descriptions, job descriptions or the use case management platform (https://ucm .buildingsmart.org/) and create a database of digital skills or define profiles for digital-enabled roles.

The third goal is the subsequent empirical implementation and review of individual levels of the reference framework using a case study on the 2008 European Football Championship in Switzerland (UEFA EURO 08). The basis for calculating the economic importance of sport in the media (first objective) is the survey of the population of the four media examined (television, newspapers, magazines, radio).

Concrete construction is very common in Switzerland (and in all industrialized countries). However, the production of concrete is very energy-intensive (particularly the production of cement) and uses a lot of (primary) gravel. To conserve gravel resources, concrete can be made from recycled (mixed) rubble. Column punching through concrete slabs is a failure mode that civil engineers prevent by appropriate design of punching shear resistance and associated structural design. The design follows the rules of the structural standard SIA 262:2013 'concrete construction'. When using recycled concrete, the SIA leaflet 2030 'recycled concrete' is added. The SIA leaflet 2030 'recycled concrete' (edition 2010) needs to be updated and is currently being revised by the SIA working group 'recycled concrete'. In the current version of the SIA-MB 2030, the punching of slabs made of recycled concrete from mixed granulate RC-M is treated very conservatively due to the lack of test results. According to the structural standard SIA 262:2013 'Concrete construction' and leaflet 2030, recycled concrete made from mixed granulate RC-M is treated like lightweight concrete and the chargeable large grain diameter Dmax=0. This results in a load-carrying capacity reduction of approx. 25% - an economical application for load-bearing panels is therefore only possible to a very limited extent. This project is intended to enable the increased use of recycled concrete from RC-M mixed demolition in building construction, especially for the ceiling slabs, and thus to conserve the (primary) gravel resource."," Jäger Andreas,  Heinzmann Daniel,  Ruckli Franz,  Rubin Karl-Heinz,  Laurent Markus,  Birbaumer Mirko,  Von Hösslin Theo", Kenel Albin

The Brienz Rothorn Bahn (BRB), with its steam locomotive fleet of three generations, is the only scheduled steam railway with historical rolling stock. It offers guests a unique experience using the fascinating technology of the steam cog railway. But the train ride, which leads through the almost untouched mountain landscape to the Brienzer Rothorn, is also an important part of the experience. In order to continue to be successful in the regional, national, but also international competitive environment, the potential of the two parts of the BRB ""Bahn"" and ""Berghaus Rothorn Kulm"" should be better used in the medium to long term. There are a number of challenges facing this objective. On the one hand, the capacity of the cable car is limited for various reasons, on the other hand, the utilization of the cable car and the Berghaus is subject to strong weather-related fluctuations. In order to counteract this, the BRB has commissioned the Institute for Tourism Economics ITW to expand the understanding of guest needs and potential demand within their guest segments. In order to be able to develop target group-oriented measures to increase occupancy, not only the needs and satisfaction of existing guests are found out. The feedback from non-guests of the BRB is also of great interest. The position and strength of your own brand should be checked with a survey of non-guests. This provides information about the perception and positioning of BRB from the market perspective and helps to gain a wide range of insights in relation to image perception, market awareness or visitor desire. On the basis of these findings, existing marketing and communication measures can be reviewed and measures developed to increase the number of guests and to open up new guest segments and markets. The review of the current price model, the price level and the price presentation of the BRB also plays an important role. As part of the ""Pricing"" work package, innovative price models within and outside the industry are being worked out for BRB and the current price perception and willingness to pay of the (existing and new) guest segments of BRB are being surveyed. In terms of comprehensive price management, the presentation and communication of BRB prices should also be optimized.

It is part of the new development of large-scale industrial belt dryers and drying cabinets. Bucher Unipektin AG is a traditional and leading manufacturer of individual machines and complete systems for the beverage and food industry. In the course of a research project, a novel desublimation system for continuous and discontinuous freeze drying processes is to be developed. When food is freeze-dried, the energy consumption is about twice as high as for normal-pressure convection drying. The energy efficiency of this process, based on the pure sublimation enthalpy of 0.8 kWh/kgH2O of the water to be discharged, is around 10%, depending on the size of the system. The sublimation of the frozen water in the drying room and the subsequent desublimation of the water vapor in the desublimation system account for the largest proportion of the energy requirement, approx. 40-70% depending on the operating pressure. In the manufacture and operation of freeze-drying systems, the desublimation system accounts for around 30% of the total costs. The desublimation system thus has a decisive influence on the energetic and economic parameters of the entire freeze-drying process. The aim of this project, funded by Innosuisse, is a desublimator prototype that stands out from today's standards thanks to its modularity, standardized design and high energy efficiency. At the beginning, a reference process of an existing, quasi-continuously operated small plant at Bucher Unipektin AG is examined theoretically and experimentally. A mathematical-physical model of the desublimation process, which depicts the dynamic heat and mass transport discretized in terms of time and location, is being developed for this purpose and validated with the reference system. This is intended to simulate the newly conceived regeneration concepts of the desublimator. Critical sub-processes are experimentally examined in the HSLU's large laboratory using functional models, with the findings flowing back into the models. With the help of the simulation results, a desublimator prototype of the more promising concept will then be designed, manufactured and experimentally examined at Bucher Unipektin AG. After further optimization steps, recommendations for upscaling and series production of the new desublimator for large industrial plants are to be derived."," Wellig Beat,  Fumey Benjamin,  Widmer Dominik,  Fill Marc,  Kleingries Mirko,  Krummenacher Moritz,  Brun Peter,  Tamburini Reto,  Pflugshaupt Ruedi,  Schmidt Stefan,  Little Stefanie,  Trachte Ulrike", Blättler Roman

The social attitude towards any form of clothing is the result of complex cultural-historical developments and is never static. The corona pandemic is currently changing the use of face coverings in Europe: Wearing everyday masks to protect against infection will probably become established as a social custom here, as in Asia. And this despite the fact that Europe, from the 19th century at the latest and right up until very recently, saw itself as a ""revealed"" society, not least in contrast to the Islamic world. The short-term lack of protective masks and clothing as well as the blocking of ordered and paid for goods by exporting countries makes small countries like Switzerland clearly aware of their dependence on transnational supply chains.

A transnational demonstration project. The project researches intelligent predictive analytics solutions for automated dynamic load management in the smart grid. The decarbonization of the energy supply means a significant expansion of the power grids at all voltage levels. Until recently, energy production was the focus of CO2 emission reduction. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the necessary goals can only be achieved if the heating and transport sectors are also decarbonized and thus electrified. The necessary renewable energy with its low energy density requires large areas to cover the energy needs of cities and industry. The spatial separation of generation and consumption therefore requires a strong grid with significant capacity, independent of attempts at local self-sufficiency. The degree of grid expansion required depends heavily on the availability of so-called “flexibility” to support the grid. In particular, the heating sector with combined heat and power and the transport sector, which triggers mobile and stationary battery applications, offer enormous future potential here. However, there is already a significant number of switchable loads and self-generation in industry and in the commercial sector. These flexibilities are generally used to limit tariff-relevant consumption peaks (so-called “peak shaving”). However, the actual physical network bottlenecks are not addressed either at the local or at the regional level. With the approach examined in the project, market-based signals for network congestion can be set and communicated, which on the one hand takes local and regional framework conditions into account and on the other hand corresponds to the regulatory requirements for the unbundling of network operators. This highly innovative approach enables network customers to pay for security of supply according to their individual needs. Dynamic price signals from both the electricity market and the grid can be used to generate an optimal schedule (""load shaping""), in which both the customer and the distribution system operator benefit equally and a macroeconomic optimum can thus be achieved. Within this framework, the HSLU is researching effective solutions for short-term forecasting at various aggregation levels of consumption and generation in a regional association of prosumers at grid levels 5 and 7."," Binder Gabriela,  Jud Martin,  Handschuh Michael,  Christen Ramón,  Meier René,  Majeed Tahir", Wilke Gwendolin

The provision costs are almost zero at times when there is a surplus; extremely high at peak consumption times. We create true-to-cost pricing for ecological and economic win-wins for everyone. The decarbonization of the economy, transport and buildings raises many fundamental questions of an economic nature that are of crucial importance for the future prosperity of our society. There is therefore a great need for practical regulatory proposals that are both economically sound and independent of particular interests. These must minimize the conflicting goals between economic performance on the one hand and security of supply, environmental compatibility and social solidarity on the other. There is a new, rapidly growing need for action in the general pricing of various energy sources – above all electricity, but also gas, for example. This goes beyond the need for a general pricing of the external (environmental) costs of energy supply. There is an increasing discrepancy with the current strategy of fixed, static end consumer prices, in particular due to the variability of the supply and demand for energy. This slows down the necessary innovations, which would enable an economically efficient and thus rapid and economically sustainable energy transition. The project starts here. It develops workable proposals for comprehensive, true-to-cost pricing, analyzes its consequences and the opportunities that result from this for the various actors. At the relevant points, centralized and decentralized producers, consumers, prosumers and transporters of energy should be exposed to fair and socially beneficial incentives.

The speed and complexity has steadily increased since then. In the project, future theses are drawn up in order to derive the next steps. The digitization of the tourism industry is essentially accelerated by the following drivers: Orientation of business processes to customer needs and the appearance of international corporations as direct competitors: The first steps towards digitizing business processes were taken in most tourism businesses for individual processes to increase internal efficiency. Today, innovative digitization steps are planned across business processes, taking guest needs into account. Tourism companies are now in competition with international IT companies, especially in marketing. Thanks to the large number of their customers, companies such as Google, Facebook, AirBnB or booking.com can gradually digitize more and more processes in a data-based and customer-oriented manner and, thanks to their size, can quickly amortize development steps through economies of scale. New IT technologies: After the turn of the millennium, digitization was primarily determined by the Internet. Today, the Internet is an element of digitization along with many other (future) technologies and trends - such as blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, e.g. machine learning, sensor technologies, robotization and miniaturization of technical components (e.g. for smartphones). Accelerated technological change: The speed of digitization has increased significantly.

In the corporate context, established business models are being questioned. The more intensive networking of people, machines and things lead to changes in the value chains. In industry, the complete computerization of production (Industry 4.0) will trigger another industrial revolution. The same applies to the service sector (service 4.0): new data-intensive services and products will expand the range. Vocational training must also anticipate the changes in the job descriptions in both commercial and commercial occupations and include digitization in the further developments of content. The various commercial, technical and industrial job descriptions will be more or less affected by digitization. Vocational training will have to provide an answer to these challenges as part of curricular development.

It causes an increasingly individualized, time- and location-independent learning and teaching with potential for individualization and flexibility. Further opportunities of digital technologies are new forms of illustration and contextualisation of what has been learned, simulations and games, interactive teaching and learning as well as a generally greater variety of methods. Of course, technological change also entails dangers and risks. So far, the resulting new operational challenges for the schools have hardly been discussed. Because digitization is causing a cultural change that goes far beyond the use of new technology. It calls for new forms of cooperation, new knowledge and new skills on the part of teachers and school administrations.

More and more electricity has to be transported over ever increasing distances. The electricity supply is becoming increasingly uneven due to the large proportion of renewable energies. The solution is to use high-temperature conductors. Classic overhead lines may be operated up to a maximum of 80°C. Thermistor cables, on the other hand, allow operating temperatures of 150°C to 200°C, which enable capacity increases of 200%. The main advantages of this solution are the much higher transport capacity and the possibility of inexpensively replacing the cables on existing routes with NTC thermistors. Despite the undisputed great potential of the new high-temperature conductors, they are currently being used very hesitantly. The biggest problem here is the lack of experience and knowledge about the internal processes of the mechanically and thermally highly stressed conductors. Furthermore, there is no knowledge of the extent to which the fittings attached to the cables and their clamping points are damaged by the increased thermal load. In the present project, simulations are carried out for the first time in connection with the associated clamping points with the help of finite element models. This allows the critical points to be examined and optimized purely virtually. This leads to specially adapted, rope-friendly solutions whose influence on the service life of the ropes is much smaller compared to today's. In this way, the most diverse, innovative constructions of fittings can be examined in advance and developed in a targeted manner at low cost. Closing these gaps and the consistent use of modern development tools at the business partner will make a significant contribution to the development of rope-friendly products. In addition to the electricity companies, their customers and thus the entire Swiss economy also benefit from reliable networks. Furthermore, massive cost savings can be achieved by reducing the very expensive long-term tests in laboratories, which are used to prove the service life influence of fittings on overhead lines."," Müller Marcel,  Provini Markus,  Novak Pavel,  Bärtsch René,  Von Hösslin Theo", Baumann Ralf

The energy efficiency of a building is not only influenced by the materials it is made of and what its energy supply looks like. The mobility of the building users also plays a decisive role. In order for this to be as environmentally friendly as possible, different parties have to work hand in hand.

Overview of the technology and evaluation of the added value. The energy transition poses a double challenge for energy suppliers and grid operators. On the one hand, they must be able to use intermittent energy sources such as wind and sun on an ever-increasing scale, but without having the necessary storage capacities for the energy generated. On the other hand, they must be able to ensure grid stability and meet consumer demand at all times. In this context, bidirectional charging of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could help to even out the decentralized fluctuations between production and consumption in the time horizon of a day. With bi-directional charging, the battery of an electric car can be viewed as an extension of the power grid and used as an energy reserve or energy storage as control resources. Electric vehicles will become part of the intelligent power grid. Bidirectional charging technology has the potential to make renewable energy integration more efficient, alleviate grid congestion and minimize grid volatility. The technology also has transformative potential for energy markets, as bi-directional charging leverages society's investments in e-mobility and makes energy supply more flexible. In this way, new business models and additional sources of income could be made possible by sharing the batteries in electric vehicles. The potential use cases for bidirectional charging are manifold. For utility companies and operators of larger EV fleets, the benefits could be significant, but regulatory requirements need to be considered. A distinction is made between two options, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-building (V2B) use cases. In V2G use cases, network services such as congestion management, frequency control, etc. are provided by BEVs, in V2B use cases, the consumption of buildings and areas could typically be optimized. However, when it comes to actual implementation, there are still many questions. There are currently hardly any charging stations that enable bidirectional charging. The vehicle models that can emit part of the energy again are just as manageable. A lot is still open when it comes to controlling the vehicles, offsetting the possible service gains, as well as user acceptance or the guarantee for the battery used. In this feasibility study, we examine the existing technologies (vehicles, charging infrastructure and software controls) and use a simulation model to check the added value of bidirectional charging infrastructure under real scenarios."," Calatroni Alberto,  Papaemmanouil Antonios,  Bowler Benjamin,  Katsoulakos Nikolaos,  Buser Roger"," Nowak Severin,  Papaemmanouil Antonios"

The aim of the project is therefore to provide and improve methods for optimized development and analysis for the new development and optimization of liquid handling systems and individual components. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts can contribute existing know-how or support industrial partners in the development tasks by adapting the existing know-how (coordination of systems, cost reductions, development times). In addition to the tools for analyzing liquid handling systems, a test stand with the usual dimensions is being set up. This allows components and development tools to be tested and checked with regard to their possible uses"," Simmen Marc,  Provini Markus,  Stern Philip,  Lustenberger Stefan,  Prud'homme Thierry,  Tresch Thomas", Haack Carsten

The development of vision sensor technology has made immense progress in recent years, especially with the miniaturization of components through System on Chip (SoC) technologies and the associated price reduction. As a result, increasingly complex vision systems can be produced at very low unit prices and thus opened up for the mass market. One example is the development of the Kinect game console, which opened up 3D vision technology for the consumer market, triggering a real hype in the games market and even in university research. It is to be expected that a similar boom will be triggered with the availability of low-cost 3D sensors for the professional sensor market (the Kinect is not suitable for this). Although there are currently 3D vision sensors for professional applications in the form of so-called ""Time of Flight"" cameras (ToF), the prices ($1000 and higher) are still far too high for widespread use. ESPROS recently started offering the “world's smallest time-of-flight camera”. Produced in SoC technology, this sensor has the potential to make ToF technology a mass product. In the ToF for Person Counting project, the possibilities and limits of ToF technology and its potential for people counting or similar applications in the field of building automation and public transport are to be evaluated in the form of a functional demonstrator."," Wyrsch Eveline,  Rosell Ortega Juan Alfonso,  Provini Markus,  Thalmann Markus,  Gilgien Pascal,  Bruderer Roger", Zahn Klaus

It also raises the question of what role social pedagogy has in day-to-day structures. The development of day schools or school day structures in Switzerland has been going on intensively for the last 10 years. The driving force behind this development can be seen in the compatibility of family and work and the resulting increased demand for childcare options that supplement the family. The establishment of day structures or day schools requires the interaction of different specialists at the school, which also includes the socio-educational specialists. However, their role is still largely unclear. The aim of this research project is therefore to investigate the technical and thus professional task of social pedagogy in the context of the development of school day structures. The focus is on the following three sub-questions: Which tasks and activities are carried out by socio-pedagogical specialists in school day structures? Which basic principles or attitudes guide socio-educational professionals in school day structures? With what goals and with which target groups do socio-educational professionals work in day-to-day school structures? The research project is qualitative. Guided interviews are carried out with socio-pedagogical specialists from different Swiss-German cantons. The results should serve to describe the still relatively new field of action of social pedagogy in day schools more comprehensively and to show possible quality standards for social pedagogical specialists in school day structures."," Dietrich Annette,  Stadelmann Karin Andrea,  Kessler Rita"," Ziegele Uri,  Stadelmann Karin Andrea"

The aim is to find scalable and cultural-politically relevant solutions that offer a high experience value and at the same time enable emotional and thus lasting learning. At the same time, concrete proposals for the digital staging of the UNESCO natural heritage, which is to be implemented in summer 2016, are being developed in joint work with students from the BA Animation and MA Short Motion. The impressive mountain world of the UNESCO World Natural Heritage Tectonic Arena Sardona represents a potential that has hardly been exploited in Swiss tourism destinations. The ""ALE"" project is dedicated to researching forms of brokering such goods with the help of mobile devices in order to make them usable for tourism value creation . The developed solutions should offer the guests of the mountain world a real experience value and at the same time enable sustainable learning about the scientific facts of the natural heritage. Augmented Reality is a technology that merges reality and virtual information. It plays a key role here, as it both augments our sense of perception of the physical environment and enriches our reality with contextual, digital information. This augmented reality gives us the opportunity to experience the mountains in a new way and to interact with them through the mobile interface. The proposed solution addresses two current problems in Swiss tourism: In summer there is still a lot of potential for Swiss tourism destinations. How can the rather fallow summer time be enriched with attractive offers for tourism guests? The intangible cultural heritage (living traditions) and the UNESCO World Heritage Site is seen by many destinations as an important part of image building/identity. However, the cultural heritage poses great challenges to the development of offers: due to the dynamic nature of the sponsorship, the intangible cultural heritage is often difficult to access for outsiders, both in terms of time and personally. Natural and cultural heritage is often not spatially accessible or the knowledge about it eludes the viewer. The question arises how this potential can be used."," Rosenberg Barbara,  Minder Schade Bettina,  Haas Jürgen,  Frei Samuel,  Fraefel Stefan,  Ziegler Ute,  Büyükberber Yasemen"," Vogelsang Axel,  Frei Samuel"

The company ANERDGY would like to develop the WindRail system, which generates electricity using wind, pressure differences and the sun in just one product. The focus is on the year-round economic and ecological power generation with very good integration into the building. The modular system is constructed as a continuous roof closure for industrial and residential buildings with a flat roof. Both existing and new buildings can be equipped with it. With the development of WindRail, an aesthetic and economical solution for the use of wind and buildings can be realized for the first time. The design has already been presented to various architects and builders and has consistently received positive feedback. As an innovative core, the new development of the flow turbine with optimized inlet and outlet is in the foreground. In order to be able to technically use the pressure differences between the façade and the inside of the roof, the wind is not only directed and optimally guided to the turbine in the area of the inlet, but its speed is also increased. In the simulation, this combined effect shows a speed increase of 20-30% compared to the wind speed in front of the building. Since the wind speed is included in the power calculation to the power of three, we expect the power to be doubled compared to a classic wind turbine with a free flow. The type of building and the dimensions have an influence which still has to be determined in the course of the project. Furthermore, the core of the R&D project is the modular structure through standardized units (power module; corner module; intermediate module) as well as the simple installation and optimized maintenance. The connection to the roof/façade also plays a central role.

Since 2016, it has been accessible online via the Silk Memory web portal for research, teaching and as a source of inspiration for contemporary design. The Product & Textile research group at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has a research focus on the Zurich silk industry. While the Silk History since 1800 project investigates the transnationally networked history of the Zurich silk industry and publishes it in a scientific book, the Silk Memory project is dedicated to the processing and mediation of material textile culture. The sources are company archives from the Zurich silk industry, which are being transferred to public memorial institutions as part of a Zurich lottery fund project and are being indexed there. The Silk Memory project aims to provide access to 200 years of Zurich silk design, from Abraham to Weisbrod-Zürrer, by creating a physical textile archive and a textile database. In close cooperation with museum cooperation partners, textile teachers and practicing designers, a representative selection of fabric samples from textile archives of the Zurich silk industry is recorded, indexed and made accessible online for teaching, research and as a source of inspiration for contemporary design work. The Silk Memory project, which is funded by the Lottery Fund of the Canton of Zurich, the Zürcherische Seidenindustrie Gesellschaft ZSIG and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, aims to scientifically process the textile heritage, make it accessible to the general public and lead to new added value. The goals in detail are: - Conception of a textile archive for the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts with a representative selection of textiles for teaching, research and as a basis for inspiration for contemporary design - Selection and categorization of the textiles using a defined grid of criteria - Recording of the textile objects a digital software according to museum standards - development of a user interface for the web portal to support inspiration processes and research work For the online presentation, the product & textile research group developed a user interface together with the Zurich design studio Astrom/zimmer.

The project examined the practice of dealing with these topics and focused on the perspective of social pedagogues. The question of how limits can be set in everyday socio-educational work and which penalties or sanctions should be used in response to violations of limits and rule violations is a regular concern for a large number of social educators in the respective residential groups. The present research project builds on these questions and empirically examines the practice of dealing with limits, rules and punishment in residential care. As part of an individual case study in an institution of residential care, documents (rule catalogues, house rules, etc.) were evaluated and qualitative interviews were carried out. The project addressed the question of how and on the basis of which considerations social pedagogues set boundaries for young people and what role punishment plays in this. As part of a case study, the project identified and reflected on the institutional framework of a residential care facility. Furthermore, concrete coping patterns and legitimation strategies of the social pedagogues with regard to limits and punishment were worked out.

A strategy is developed in a participatory process based on a SWOT analysis. Early support is quite well developed in the canton of Basel-Stadt compared to other Swiss-German cantons. Five departments in the canton's administration deal with different aspects of early support (e.g. financing of childcare places, language support, offers for families with a migration background), and the canton is involved in the financing of many of these offers. Since Switzerland invests very little in early childhood in an international comparison, there are still gaps in the canton of Basel-Stadt. In addition, the administrative structures have adapted to the dynamic field of early support in a way that is sometimes confusing and does not optimally exploit existing synergies. Against this background and in view of the great educational, social and health policy importance of the early years, those responsible in the education department decided to have a strengths/weaknesses analysis of the offers in the field and the units in the cantonal administration made and, on this basis, a strategist of developing early support."," Meier Magistretti Claudia,  Abbas Marina,  Wyss Sabrina", Hafen Martin

The ""Mission statement for a child and youth-friendly policy for the municipality of Muri"" dating back to 2000 was drawn up by municipal politicians and specialists. In 2011 it was revised by the specialist committee for children and youth issues and subsequently approved by the municipal council. A needs and resource analysis carried out in a district of Muri-Gümligen in 2014 showed that there is an increasing demand for mobile and outreach offers in child and youth work. On this basis, a new rough concept for open child and youth work was created in 2015, in which additional projects were included. In addition to the twelve existing and proven OKJA projects, 17 new projects have been defined, of which OKJA is solely responsible for five projects, while the others are carried out with a partner organization (scouts, municipal council, integration competence center, etc.). Since its introduction in 2011, the requirements for the OKJA have become more demanding and complex. While the development task of forming a positive self-relationship in childhood and adolescence[1] with the elements of self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem remains valid, the challenges that children and adolescents have to master have changed significantly. They too have to deal with a daily flood of information and consumer offers; much has been monetized to a large extent, which requires sovereign handling of money; or the social change can be seen, for example, in school classes with a high proportion of children with a migration background or in the increasing divorce rates, which also affect children and young people; Furthermore, choosing a career and finding a suitable apprenticeship place is a major burden for many young people. And finally, there are two areas of conflict in the lives of many children and young people: on the one hand, as consumers, they are already considered full members of society at a young age, on the other hand, longer educational paths, later attachment and starting a family lead to a longer adolescence. Not only the youth themselves, but also the work of youth workers has become more complex.[2] [1] Erik H. Erikson, Identity and Life Cycle, Frankfurt/M. 1974, p. 62ff.

This know-how is multiplied by the publication of a handbook. The community of car-free Swiss tourist locations (GaST) unites the destinations Morschach-Stoos, Rigi, Riederalp, Bettmeralp and Saas Fee, among others. A large survey of second-home owners and day and multi-day guests showed that freedom from cars is of paramount importance when choosing a destination. However, there are problems with the implementation in all destinations because there are relatively many vehicles on the road for the transport of people, luggage and alpine farming. Accordingly, the guests are only moderately satisfied with the implementation of car-freedom. In a subsequent phase, innovative mobility solutions were tested in four GaST destinations. However, permanent implementation could only be achieved in a few cases. A handbook was published in March 2014, which uses over 20 practical examples to show that and how soft mobility in tourism can already be implemented today. The handbook is available to other interested destinations (see ""Link"" below for more information on the handbook). In addition to practical examples, it also provides a set of arguments for soft mobility, an implementation guide and ""ready-to-use"" products for quick and easy implementation. Finally, in a training session, those responsible in the communities and tourist destinations addressed can be trained in the implementation of suitable mobility offers. As part of the project, the project team also acted as an intermediary between the SBB and the car-free destinations, namely as part of the introduction of the new ""door-to-door luggage transport"" product, which was launched by the SBB in autumn 2013. The ""Gentle Mobility in Alpine Destinations"" project has prominent sponsors in the form of the Federal Office for Spatial Development, the Swiss Tourist Association, the Association of Public Transport and the Association of Car-Free Swiss Tourist Destinations. It is supported by Innotour and a private foundation and is carried out by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and the ARGE solèr/cebulla.

The design of the public space in the city of Zurich is planned and implemented by the Civil Engineering Department. This also includes the equipment, eg with seating. Numerous other administrative units are involved in operation and maintenance. While the designers are primarily focused on the aesthetically pleasing cityscape, it is safety for the police and accessibility for the officers for equal opportunities for people with disabilities. There are considerable conflicts of interest, especially with regard to seating: while benches are being removed because they are undesirable magnets for gatherings of young people and marginalized people in certain places, additional seating is required in the interests of age-appropriate public spaces. On behalf of and for the attention of the public space working group, the civil engineering office (design of urban spaces) together with the other stakeholders has drawn up an overview of the framework conditions and the different practices and attitudes in dealing with the different needs for benches. On this basis, the scope for action was determined and approaches for future strategies were outlined. The findings from this interpretation can be summarized as follows: There are very complex and diverse responsibilities Different orders result in different priorities Partly there is already a need for coordination within the office Benches are removed in the event of conflicts of use, mainly due to external pressure Important: There are no fundamentally different attitudes. Conflicts of use should be resolved and not resolved, for example, by removing benches. The following potentials were identified: Benches are key elements for enlivening public spaces and improving the quality of stay Better coordination with the needs of users can make better use of this potential The needs must be identified together with the users Knowledge management can be used to collect knowledge and used The most suitable types and locations of the benches are developed most easily during operation.

Recruiting suitable workers is a major challenge for the hospitality industry in Switzerland. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the staff is recruited abroad, with the majority of them being short-term residents of less than twelve months. They come – often regularly – to Switzerland for a seasonal position. However, finding accommodation for short-term stays and for qualified personnel moving to the area is difficult and involves a great deal of effort. In addition, rental prices, especially in the centers and typical tourist regions, are expensive in relation to wages in the hospitality industry. In order to counteract the shortage of workers and the high fluctuation rate in the long term and sustainably, the hospitality industry must become more attractive. At the same time, additional services are becoming increasingly important when deciding on a job. In cooperation with hotel companies in the city of Lucerne, the ""Home4Staff"" project is investigating what needs workers in the hospitality industry have in terms of housing. It is examined to what extent the housing offer offers an advantage in attracting workers.

The structural codes are used in most cases for definitive structures with service lives between 50 and 100 years. The basics for determining the load factors, the load combinations, the effects and other specifications for the project planning of temporary structures are not explicitly regulated in the SIA standards. Cases of damage in the past show that, for example, the effects of wind or snow on temporary supporting structures are often underestimated. Conversely, temporary structures such as provisional bridges are dimensioned with the same design loads as the definitive structures. This leads to unnecessary additional costs. On the basis of the assessment basis of the Eurocodes and a procedure for cost optimization and taking personal safety into account, a service life factor analogous to the failure sequence factor is introduced. The procedure is shown and the various boundary conditions (model, distribution, statistical parameters) and their influences are recorded. The effects of wind, snow and road traffic are primarily taken into account. The applicability is being checked for extraordinary influences such as earthquakes and impacts, if necessary extended and discussed accordingly. The objective is a single utilization factor, i.e. identical for variable or permanent actions, which establishes a relationship between the design design of 50 years of useful life (current Swiss standards) and the useful life of the temporary structure and no other parameters (materials, variable or permanent loads, load case combinations) is dependent.", Rohrer Martina, Kenel Albin

Questions about the quality of life of the patients and the efficiency of care in the Lucerne region were in the foreground. From a holistic perspective, the entire patient journey was examined. The following five theses were developed on the basis of an exploratory literature search on critical aspects and findings in cancer care and 11 expert interviews with specialists from the fields of oncology, Spitex, general practitioners, psycho-oncology, social services, palliative care and the Cancer League Central Switzerland. Thesis 1: The needs of patients and their relatives should be known better and included more in treatment decisions. Thesis 2: Interprofessional and interinstitutional cooperation should be systematized and simplified and promoted through suitable communication channels and financing mechanisms. Thesis 3: The financing modalities should be adjusted to enable holistic treatment and care with as few ""breaks"" as possible. Thesis 4: Clearer strategies, goals and processes are needed at the political and professional level in order to develop cancer care in the desired direction. Thesis 5: Both quantitative and qualitative data should be continuously collected and used for the further development of cancer care. These theses serve as a basis for discussion as part of a more extensive main project. In individual cases and depending on the context, they are more or less correct. For the main project, the regional focus was extended to all of Central Switzerland. The central elements of the project are a written survey of cancer patients and their relatives and a solution-oriented ""dialogue process"". In the form of smaller and larger events resp. In workshops and discussions, the various actors and stakeholder groups should come into contact with each other in a goal-oriented setting, maintain a dialogue and develop optimization projects. The main project will be realized from autumn 2018 to the end of 2021. The implementation of selected pilot projects may take longer. The main project (like the feasibility study) is financed 80 percent by the bio-pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of All.Can Switzerland (https://www.allcan-schweiz.ch/), the remaining funds come from the research funding of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

For the evaluation, the content of the participant dossier prepared by the foundation was analyzed and interviews were conducted with six participants, two course instructors and a specialist from the assigning office of the Canton of Lucerne. The young participants can no longer be admitted to compulsory school because of their age, but they cannot be integrated into an apprenticeship or job because of insufficient language skills and little school education. In the integration offer, they are taught German, mathematics and general education. The primary goal is professional integration, for which the participants are prepared through intensive professional coaching, various trial apprenticeships and work assignments. The offer represents an important and necessary catchment area for the target group described in the canton of Lucerne. The integration offer enjoys a high level of acceptance among the participants. They feel the program has contributed significantly to their professional maturity. In the 2012/13 training year, almost half of the participants found a subsequent professional solution in the form of an internship or an apprenticeship (EBA or EFZ). All respondents experienced the course of the training year as positive and stated that their technical and business skills had improved. The positive development of economic skills can also be seen in the participant dossiers examined.

The space requirement for the 2017-2019 planning period is to be determined on the basis of the results of the forecast model and taking into account contextual developments relevant to demand. Two goals are pursued within the framework of the project. On the one hand, the annual data quality control is intended to ensure that the data available are of high quality when the forecast report for the 2017-2019 planning period begins. On the other hand, the development of the 2017-2019 planning report aims to identify the offer or the number of places that should be made available in the canton of Zurich for the 2017-2019 period.

The hypothesis that there is a discrepancy between the normative theory of output-oriented control and the practice of New Public Management (NPM) was confirmed in this project. The controlling results are sometimes used very incompletely for political control. However, this finding is still provisional. It is based on an evaluation of studies from abroad and on a small series of interviews with Swiss actors involved in political planning and management from NPM local authorities (executive, legislative, top management, controlling services in NPM cantons and larger communities). The interviews have also shown that the subject is a burning issue for the actors interviewed. At the same time, however, it can also be determined that the discrepancy between output-oriented controlling theory and practice is perceived very differently. Differences can also be seen in the design of the controlling system, both in the controlling instruments used and in the organization of the controlling processes.

With the corona pandemic, consumption shifted to online channels. This posed challenges for providers of advice-intensive, high-involvement consumer goods. The implementation of an online consultation forces companies to make some decisions regarding technical implementation, interviewing and internal organization. Which form of implementation do you choose: spontaneously or by appointment, with or without a chat function, with two-sided or one-sided image transmission, with or without chat - or only with audio? Do they automate the initiation of a conversation with a chatbot and if so, how does the transition to a consultation take place? How do you visually draw visitors' attention to the consultation: via a fly-in button, on every product page, on the notepad or in the shopping cart? When do you point out the advice to visitors: in the first second of the page load, with a delay or only after a certain behavior, such as comparing products? To what extent are upstream touchpoints of the customer journey used to refer to online advice, such as blog articles based on SEO keyword sets and a YouTube channel? How do you make the transition from the consultation to the actual purchase: Should the customer service staff go to the checkout with the caller or just make a purchase recommendation? All these questions can only be answered together with the target group. However, their needs have changed over the course of the pandemic. Customers have become affine with video conferencing and consumption has shifted to virtual space. What does this mean for the design of online counseling? The list of questions above shows the importance of ""virtual contact"", the transition from anonymous browsing to personal live video advice. For comparison: At the real point of sale, specialist advisors can address customers directly. In the online setting, however, this approach is impersonal and must be implemented technically skilfully. The preliminary project showed that online advice via live video in pre-sales is practically unexplored. This is remarkable, since at the same time there is talk of a ""crisis of immediacy"", i.e. of customers who want immediate advice at any time.

At the strategic level, there is the problem that the digitization of communication has created different communication spaces, some of which are beyond the control and control of the company. However, established communication management models and procedures no longer do justice to the changed conditions. What is necessary is their further development towards an integration of the reference groups into the processes, greater transparency, new public forms of communication and the enabling of increased customer-customer interactions. At the operational level, the challenge is to design a networked use of online and offline channels based on the changing interaction and information behavior of the target groups. The digitization and individualization of communication is also forcing companies to come up with concepts that ensure transparency and honesty in dialogue, since it is hardly possible to cover up facts. If the companies consciously decide to intensify digital dialogue with the target groups, this requires a willingness to communicate and openness to their concerns and arguments, e.g. in the context of product policy decisions, since the companies are only then taken seriously as dialogue partners. As a result, the complexity as well as the monitoring and control requirements for communication are increasing. On the one hand, the changed control requirements result from the fact that effectiveness controls in sub-areas of digital media are much more difficult to carry out than in the ""controlled"" environment of classic media. In addition, there is the challenge of combining the control instruments and parameters of the classic and digital media into a meaningful overall system. The research project is primarily based on the research findings of the research projects ""Online/Offline 2"" and ""Integrated Communication and Digitization"". The focus of the research project is on the one hand the validation and further elaboration of the toolbox developed as part of the ""Online/Offline 2"" project for planning cross-media campaigns and the measurement model for checking its effectiveness. On the other hand, the development of a concept for digitized integrated communication as well as measures for the organizational-structural, personnel and system-specific further development of the communication areas in companies and institutions. For this purpose, expert interviews were carried out in an explorative preliminary study."," Georgi Dominik,  Schaffner Dorothea,  Mohr Seraina,  Fries Tobias,  Stalder Ursula", Boenigk Michael

The project deals with learning in virtual spaces using virtual and augmented reality. The apprentices prepare themselves for the working world in the vocational schools, in the inter-company courses and in the apprenticeship company and train themselves to become specialists in their respective professions. With virtual and augmented reality, a completely new virtual place of learning opens up, in which mistakes are welcome in order to gain valuable experience. For example, as a health specialist in training, you can swap medicines in virtual space without suffering serious consequences. The first pilot classes of the GIBZ will deal with different new learning formats in basic education and in the vocational baccalaureate. The project started in January 2021 with the basic planning work. The first three clusters (health, planning and natural sciences) were defined. In a second step, learning content will now be described in VR, AR and 3D and implemented together with the Immersive Realities Center team at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. In a further phase, in addition to the GIBZ learners, the training companies and the relevant inter-company course centers (ÜK) can also offer training units in the Interaction Space of the HSLU Computer Science.

The air permeability measurement is the only measure in the construction process that delivers qualitative and quantitative results with little effort. It therefore enjoys a high level of acceptance among property developers, buyers and tenants. Based on this study, the air permeability measurement and the high demands on airtightness in MINERGIE-P and MINERGIE-A buildings can be described as a useful instrument for long-term quality assurance in the construction process and in operation. In 25 properties (mostly certified according to MINERGIE-P), the airtightness measurement carried out after completion of construction was repeated after a certain period of use. This was used to examine whether the airtightness of a building envelope changes over time or not. If the airtightness does not change over time, the corresponding measurement after completion of construction is an important quality feature. If the airtightness should deteriorate with increasing building age, the measurement at the time of construction completion becomes less important. The investigation shows a pleasingly positive picture for the examined objects. The awareness and sensitivity of planners and contractors for the topic of ""airtightness"" as well as the practical check seem to have a positive effect on the quality, including the durability of the measures."," Notter Gregor,  Menti Urs-Peter", Bossard Beda

There are initial approaches to holiday apartments, but private landlords are reluctant to make changes to prices. What could price changes look like? Demand for vacation rentals has increased during the pandemic. However, many rental prices have remained constant. The design of dynamic prices for holiday home rentals is a challenge, although individual tourism segments such as hotels or airlines have been using dynamic prices successfully for years. One reason is that the vacation rental market is very different from the market for hotel room rentals or other travel products. The following points show the difference between the holiday apartment market and other tourist services: Atomized market: Many landlords rent a few (often only one) object(s) Rented objects are often unique, e.g. in terms of location, equipment and age, which makes price comparison difficult The occupancy of holiday apartments is between 10 and 40 weeks As a pure intermediary, E-Domizil does not own apartments or operate resorts and therefore has no price sovereignty The market works differently depending on the region Landlords do not want to risk their property being rented less often, especially in the high season will than in the past. Before vacation rental owners change prices, they want to be as sure as possible that they're still making sales. Destination management organizations give holiday home owners assistance with regard to handing over keys when they are absent, cleaning, marketing on the Internet, etc., but are reluctant to make recommendations for price adjustments that are not empirically supported. Even holiday home brokers are currently unable to make any reliable data-based statements or even forecasts on (dynamic) price adjustments and their effects on profitability.

The history of the organ in the canton of Schwyz has hardly been researched to this day; there is no publication that summarizes this history. Short works by Otto Tschümperlin and Josef Schelbert from the 1970s and 1980s describe some of the existing instruments, but without providing any historical background. According to the information available in the Organ Documentation Center (ODZ), the earliest documents on the history of Schwyz organ building date from the 16th century and relate to organs in the Schwyz area. At no time was there a local organ building company in Canton Schwyz. For this reason, orders to build instruments have gone to a large number of organ building companies of various origins over the centuries. Accordingly, the variety of different instruments is considerable. The last 30 years are not very representative of this development, since new organs in the canton have been built almost exclusively by the two companies Mathis (Näfels) and Metzler (Dietikon) since the 1980s. The Swiss Organ Inventory is a project started in 1986 by Prof. Dr. Max Lütolf and Dr. Urs Fischer has been initiated. For this purpose, the ""Swiss Organ Inventory Commission"" was founded in 1987. The commission formed a working group to assist the various cantonal authorities (monument preservation offices) with the inventory. At that time, the organ inventory of the canton of Schwyz was under the responsibility of Mr. Otto Tschümperlin, but it was not completed after the district of Schwyz and a few other instruments in the district of Küssnacht had been recorded.

The perspective of ""Organizational Energy"" aims to raise awareness of the fact that those structural patterns that are responsible for the innovative success of companies can be found in the ""interstices of the social"". In the past 10 years, the organizational conditions for innovation have been viewed primarily from an organizational-cultural and rational management-oriented perspective. A new, energy-based perspective is now to be held against this. Businesses today need to innovate in order to adapt to dynamic environmental conditions and ensure their long-term survival. However, the practiced innovation management often lags behind the rapid environmental changes. Innovation management is also confronted with the problem of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Consequently, it must also innovate itself. But what does innovation management look like that relates the innovation aspect to itself? The starting point here is an integrated approach, which understands innovative innovation management as a cross-divisional function."," Wyss Sabrina,  Kaudela-Baum Stephanie", Dievernich Frank

The pianist Irène Schweizer has won great international recognition as a representative of Swiss jazz. She is an influential pioneer of the independent jazz and improvisational scenes in Europe. Schweizer's artistic activity is closely linked to her political commitment: she advocates equality for women in art and society. It stands for the artistic and economic autonomy of artists. Irène Schweizer was born on June 2, 1941 in Schaffhausen. In 1960, the autodidact won the amateur jazz festival in Zurich. The innovative South African exile scene in the Zurich jazz club Africana became their musical home in the 1960s. The music of the New York free jazz pianist Cecil Taylor also had a significant influence on Schweizer's artistic development. In the 1970s, Schweizer stayed in Berlin for several years and became an important source of inspiration for the European free music scene and one of its most important exponents. In numerous duo projects, Schweizer is trying out new forms of interaction, including with leading representatives of Afro-American and South African music. Schweizer's first free jazz concert in Willisau in 1968 (see photo p.5) became the starting point for the unprecedented success story of advanced jazz in the 'Lucerne hinterland'.

Unmotivated teaching, which often leads to unnecessary learning interruptions, is an all too common consequence of this deficiency. A toolbox for the analysis and solution of challenging teaching situations is to be provided as part of the solution-oriented instrumental teaching project. For this purpose, the model developed from practical work uses a number of applications from the social sciences and adapts them to the specific situation of music learning at music schools. The key points of the model are a focus on the resources of the learners with the enabling of decisive points of contact as well as forms of collegial advice between teachers.

In order to counteract the competitive pressure, findings from price psychology are put into practice and checked. Price psychology is a relatively young approach to behavioral pricing theory, which deals with the way customers gather, evaluate and store information. The basis for this research area is the increasing integration of psychological research into various areas of economics. Despite the increasing popularity of the concept and numerous price psychological experiments in the laboratory, behavioral pricing has so far hardly been used systematically in practice. The effects are even less checked quantitatively. This also applies to the travel industry, where larger providers in particular occasionally use price psychological elements, but the exact effects are hardly analyzed scientifically. Industry-specific findings for the Swiss travel market are not yet available. With increasing competition and price pressure, the well-founded use of price psychological measures and their impact analysis in the field is also of great interest from a practical point of view. The CTI project generates new knowledge for research and practice by developing suitable price psychological measures for Swiss travel providers and testing them in the market (carrying out field experiments). Through targeted adjustments in the product range, price presentation and communication, the sale of more performance-intensive offers at the practice partners should be increased and profitability should be increased in the long term.

The results can be summarized as follows: A method was developed that allows the attack times of a keystroke on the piano to be measured with an accuracy of approx. 10ms. The method works in LARA with two different volume levels and filters. In the case of Chopin's op. 28/4, it provides very good measurement data. Two topics would need to be explored further: 1) The method is extremely time-consuming. It should be checked whether the semi-automatic Rhythmic Event Detector developed by Lorenz Kilchenmann for percussive music (Projects: Auditory Synchronicity I 08-478 and II 09-530) can also be applied to polyphonic piano music with the help of filters. 2) The precision of the method would have to be systematically ascertained using a large amount of data. The entry times of Argerich's recording of the Preludes op. 28/4 were measured and visualized for the solo part and the accompaniment (one measurement per chord). The agogic invariants described in the research literature can be confirmed for this recording: the ritardando at phrase ends (Clarke 1999) and the melody lead (Goebl 2001) are noticeable. The evaluation of the data for the left hand also revealed a global model for the agogic design of bars: Argerich accentuates the bar focuses with local ritardandi. Results of the project were presented on December 16, 2009 at the ""International Symposium on Performance Science"" (ISPS 2009, Auckland NZ). The presentation focused on bars 13-15 and discussed Argerich's Accelerando against the background of the bar model and in relation to the harmonic development of the composition. Further project results were published in the Proceedings of ISPS 2009: The article focuses on bars 1-4 of Argerich's recording and discusses how the upbeats of the solo melody affect the agogic design of the phrase boundaries.

Synchronization results of short and slowly oscillating sounds (transient time up to the amplitude maximum > 27 ms) show large scatters (standard deviation: 29.5 ms).

This project focuses on specific communal challenges and solution approaches of the militia system in peripheral areas. The role of the municipalities in federal Switzerland is central. However, the framework conditions for the provision of public services have changed at the municipal level. The complexity of municipal tasks and the demands on the professionalism of the services provided have increased, which poses great challenges for municipal organizations in peripheral areas in particular when it comes to task management and the recruitment of staff for their executive offices and commissions. There are major regional differences in the organization of community leadership, the basic understanding of politics and the associated socio-cultural context. Against this background, the present project systematically investigates the question of the spatial differentiation and sustainability of the municipal militia system in the peripheral area of Switzerland - this with an interdisciplinary approach at the interfaces between political, sociological and regional economic perspectives. The preliminary project aims to create the conditions for a third-party funded main project in which the research team will work directly with communities to collect data."," Magnin Chantal,  Steiner Thomas", Willisegger Jonas

In recent years, Switzerland has seen an increase in FinTechs (particularly in the area of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)) and has regularly ranked among the top three FinTech hubs worldwide[1]. Today, around 130 FinTechs with a focus on DLT are based in Switzerland[2]. However, the new technology not only brings great opportunities, but also risks. One of these risks is money laundering through cryptocurrencies, for which DLT (blockchains) form the technological infrastructure. Due to their pseudo-anonymity, cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity to launder proceeds from criminal activities. In 2018, the federal government classified the risk of money laundering via blockchains as high[3]. Traditional anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance processes can currently only be applied to digital assets and cryptocurrencies in a very limited way, which in turn makes the latter very attractive for criminal activities. The aim of the Innosuisse project is to set up a blacklisting platform that creates transparency and minimizes the risk of money laundering. The platform includes a database in which crypto financial service providers can anonymously report risk scores as well as customers or crypto coins related to illegal activities. Thanks to the Confidential Computing method, neither the platform provider nor the requesting institution finds out who made which data available. The added value of this platform is that crypto financial service providers can check their customers or coins and receive a benchmark for their risk assessment. Swiss financial institutions benefit twice from the platform. On the one hand, they can protect themselves from suspicious customers and transactions, on the other hand, they have the opportunity to alert customers to suspicious coins at an early stage. In this way, it can be prevented that crypto money, which originates from illegal activities, enters the economic cycle and is laundered. Financial institutions also protect themselves from risks and manifest a compliant and sustainable management. With this platform, financial institutions can fight money laundering together in the future. The benefit of the Innosuisse project is reflected in the reduced economic damage thanks to the detection and prevention of money laundering in the crypto sector. In addition, a proactive approach against money laundering via blockchains protects Switzerland's reputation as a «crypto nation»[4].

A film history Swiss film historiography is characterized by the exclusion of substructures such as experimental or animated films. ""Swiss Film Experiments 1950-1988"" opens up the history of experimental film in Switzerland for the first time. Swiss film historiography is characterized by the exclusion of substructures such as experimental or animated films. The project ""Swiss Film Experiments 1950-1988"" opens up for the first time the history of experimental film in Switzerland and its intensive international integration through comprehensive research and interpretive analysis of widely scattered sources. Written sources are supplemented by oral memories from contemporary witnesses The project forms the basis for a previously missing overall perspective on the history of experimental film in Switzerland. Historically, experimental filmmaking has always been very close to, or explicitly differentiated from, the fine arts. For this reason, the project attaches importance to the classification of the data not only in the context of film studies, but also of art history. The processing of the history of this marginalized cinema thus strives for a more precise understanding of Swiss film and art history and its selective reassessment. From 2015, the results of the research project will be available in book publications, an exhibition, lectures, film programs and in the media archive of the arts of the ZHdK made. The aim is: an anthology of experimental Swiss film for the period covered; a collection of materials that today makes widely scattered, only partially written sources accessible; an in-depth dissertation on a partial aspect of the desired story; an exhibition with films and other artistic works by the participating film artists; as well as a collection with a representative selection of films that is to be made accessible on the Internet.

The Innosuisse project ""Digital change in controlling"" answers this question. A maturity model and a Switzerland-wide study show the current status and allow further location determination. The Swiss corporate landscape is characterized by technological progress and continuous digitization. As a result, more and more data is available to companies. In the last two years alone, the amount of data available has increased ninefold and this growth will continue in the coming years. At the same time, the possibilities for analyzing data are developing rapidly thanks to new technologies. The application of complex and resource-intensive analysis methods becomes easier and more intuitive. This environment opens up new possibilities, new tasks and new challenges, especially for controlling. However, new technologies and increasing amounts of data are also unsettling many finance functions and especially controlling functions. Questions regarding the correct use of technologies, methods and data must be answered. The abundance of technological developments and their very different effects require a clear plan for their use. The automation and standardization of transactional processes, which today represent a large part of the activities of controlling functions, can significantly increase the efficiency of controlling. With resources released, new, information-generating technologies can be used. The digitization of the controlling function means that controllers will need new skills in the future in order to be able to use digitization and add value as a business partner for the company. The Innosuisse project ""Digital Change in Controlling"" deals with the central issues of the digitization of controlling functions in Swiss companies, provides an overview of the current status of digitization and provides practice-oriented impulses on how controlling functions can profitably use the digital potential for themselves can. With the help of a maturity model, the digital maturity of controlling functions can be assessed in the five dimensions of data, technologies, processes, methods and competencies. The study prepared in 2018 contains a map of digitization in Switzerland and a roadmap for digitization in controlling. All in all, a guide to digitalization in controlling should be given, which not only helps individual controlling functions to assess their own digital status, but also shows the way to achieve the desired level of digitalization for the respective function.

The Swiss economy is currently dominated by a predominantly linear sales model: products are manufactured, used and disposed of again. Economic growth is closely linked to the consumption of resources and the longevity of products from the point of view of companies is more negative than positive for their sales. In addition to enormous environmental costs and social problems, this philosophy also harbors political and economic risks: raw materials are only available in finite quantities, our economy is dependent on other countries and uncontrollable price fluctuations. As part of this study, possible solutions to promote a circular construction and real estate industry in Switzerland are examined. In interdisciplinary cooperation between the Department of Economics (IFZ / CC Immobilien) and the Institute for Building Technology and Energy (HSLU T&A), the various challenges and opportunities of the circular economy are considered from a structural, ecological and economic point of view. Research on existing international models of the circular economy is carried out together and their applicability in Switzerland is discussed in an interdisciplinary manner. An internal workshop is also planned. The aim of the ITC preliminary project is to bring together the various competencies of the university, strengthen the internal network and jointly develop a concept for a third-party funded main project."," Kenel Albin,  Grimm Christine,  Bionda Davide,  Geissbühler Dieter,  Schmidiger Markus,  King Marvin,  Basten Rosalie Mara,  Geier Sonja"," Büttner Sina,  King Marvin"

The project was developed together with the HSLU and the implementation was evaluated by the HSLU. Between 2012 and 2014, the social institutions and businesses of the city of Zurich ran a ""Supported Employment"" offer as part of a pilot project. The aim of the offer is long-term placement, which includes close individual support and support in the job search and, after starting a job, in the within the framework of individual follow-up support for twelve months. The pilot project has been evaluated by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The present evaluation report and the statements and recommendations formulated in it are based on the systematically collected data and experiences. During the period of the study, a total of 40 people participated in the Pilot Supported Employment. The placement rate at the time of exit from the place phase is 48%. The placement rate at the time of exit from the SE offer cannot yet be determined. The central value of the SE offer lies in the individual, narrow, binding and long-term designed accompaniment of the participants with regard to a sustainable professional integration. The offer is generally very much appreciated by both the professional actors involved and the participants. The target group definition, which was deliberately left open in the concept for the pilot, has been adhered to. It is striking that both the performance and motivation of the participants are generally high. In addition, the field of participants turned out to be very heterogeneous. The highly individualized working method of the coach, which is adapted to the respective person and situation, is a prerequisite for dealing with heterogeneity. The greatest challenge of the SE offer lies in the very limited access to the general labor market, the acquisition of suitable positions is extremely difficult and time-consuming. Against this background, employment relationships have repeatedly been entered into that can be described as precarious in various respects and/or are located in the low-wage sector. Job coaches and project managers emphasize that they regard this as an ""intermediate step""; at the same time, they point out the important meaning that such contacts or experiences can have for the participants. Under these conditions, the training phase or follow-up support is of particular importance: It is used intensively to improve or stabilize the working conditions once they have been achieved in terms of sustainability. A wide variety of connection solutions have been recommended for people whose participation was terminated without a successful placement. The interviews with the participants show that the experience of the individual support, the clarification of the next steps and the specific tips are also valued independently of a placement success and can be significant. The evaluation team recommends continuing the offer."," Trommsdorff Göth Barbara,  Schaufelberger Daniel,  Doerk Michael", Mey Eva

So that this is possible and can be guaranteed into old age, good care is also required on the part of social pedagogy. Social pedagogy assumes that aging can be shaped and that abilities and skills are learned throughout life. She acts principle-guided throughout her life, which means that she orients her work and actions for and with her clientele in particular to the following four working principles (cf. Stadelmann & Kessler, 2021): Coping with life and life High quality of life Participation and participation, also with Dependencies Self-determination and empowerment These four working principles were visualized in a model specially developed by the project managers. For each working principle, the model shows central indicators, researched from previous theoretical and empirical foundations, which are essential for their implementation and thus for good care in old age. The present project examines which actions in practice or in everyday life with older and old people are behind these working principles and how these are observed, produced and implemented in practice by social pedagogy. Empirical findings for the implementation of the four working principles are provided and guidelines for practice are derived by means of video recordings of selected situations in inpatient institutions for the elderly and outpatient services, as well as expert discussions.

Sputnique Creative GmbH has been working in the glasses business for years. The processes are globalized. The company wants to make production more environmentally friendly and start production in Switzerland. The glasses are made from recycled PET in a CO2-neutral manner in the Zurich area. In the last 2 years, the company has developed a manufacturing process that amazes even the experts with its perfect surfaces and its simplicity. The glasses are produced with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. FDM technology is the technology that is the most cost-effective and energy-saving. In addition, 100% recycled material can be used. The technology is tried and tested, but often too unaesthetic for end products. We combine a new technique with an old technique. The first step of manufacturing with the FDM printers is new. However, the raw products come out of the 3D printers flat. The next processes are then based on the tried and tested production of glasses made of acetate. Sputnique Creative also has to shape their glasses with heat in the second process. This process is not yet mature. There is a lack of elementary knowledge about times, temperatures, changes in the material in relation to distortion, stability, etc. The HSLU is intended to support the company as part of this preliminary study in stabilizing the entire production process and making it suitable for mass production.", Korner Leonz," Minonne Clemente,  Korner Leonz"

The city of Zug and in particular the districts in the west of the city are in a process of spatial, structural and social development. In addition to the already existing, scattered settlements, numerous new development areas are being built. As the old and new settlements grow together, connected urban areas are formed in the west of the city. The two districts of Lorzen and Herti differ significantly: While large areas of attractive residential and commercial areas with very little infrastructure and no actual center are developing in Lorzen, an urban agglomeration of residential and working areas with large-scale infrastructure facilities such as sports facilities and the Herti shopping center. The new ice rink, the striking high-rise building and the ""Arenaplatz"" were built right next to it. These mark the new center of Zug West. As part of the revision of the local planning, the boundary conditions for the structural development of the city were set. However, the question arose as to whether the offer and infrastructure still correspond to the changed requirements and what action needs to be taken as a result.

Financing and control models in child and youth welfare The financing system for nursing homes in Switzerland is heterogeneous and complex due to federalism. The development of financing and control models in child and youth welfare is reconstructed from an economic-historical perspective. The study is being carried out as part of the National Research Program 76 ""Care and Coercion"" (NRP76). Based on three contrasting cantons, the financing modes in the home system are examined at the federal, cantonal and local level with special consideration of the federalist structures in the Swiss welfare state. At the same time, in the sense of a mixed welfare economy, the role played by state and private actors in the financing of the facilities is of interest. Subsidies are usually associated with certain expectations of professional service delivery. In this context, we reconstruct the financing and control models in homes and ask how they have developed and changed in the period from 1940 to the present day. In a further step, it is examined to what extent the requirements linked to subsidies for the service provided have contributed to promoting quality and professionalism in the homes. The project is interdisciplinary and examines the topic from an economic and historical perspective. The (interim) results of the research are discussed with practice partners at regular intervals.

Particular attention was paid to the aspect of responsible implementation of gender and diversity. Diversity management is a new design principle in dealing with variety, difference and pluralism. The aim is to establish equal opportunities while recognizing diversity. The discussion about diversity management in business administration and in companies is about creating new conditions so that employees can develop and unfold their ability and willingness to perform without restrictions. This should be possible regardless of the structural categories of gender, origin, ethnicity, culture or age. The first part of the study deals with the legal anchoring of diversity at Swiss universities as well as the essential questions according to the categories: - Origin: domestic, foreign or both? – Cultural diversity: vocabulary for describing «modern heterogeneity» in Switzerland – nearness to education and distance from education or after all class and class? – People with disabilities: enabling access to higher education – “Junior” and “Sénior”: the construction sociale de l'âge – Sexual identity: an issue for higher education? – Genre et diversité: aperçu sur le debate in France Country studies were prepared for the second part: – Germany: Diversity for excellence – Great Britain: Beyond diversity, equality?

How can podcasts be used for corporate communication? The power of podcasts is not new: there is less distraction via the audio channel and the attention span is longer. Listeners can pursue other activities at the same time, companies can present their messages in more detail. What is new, however, are the options for consuming podcasts. Originally it was just the apps from Apple, Google and a few niche products like Deezer, but Spotify and Facebook have recently also focused heavily on the podcast genre. Internally, the IKM already has a lot of expertise in the area of voice interfaces and content marketing. Research in the field of corporate podcasts builds on these areas of competence and explores the question of how podcasts can be used sensibly for corporate communication. The goal is a guide for Swiss SMEs that shows when podcasts are the right instrument for corporate communication and what should be considered when implementing them. This gives rise to the following sub-questions: Which goals can be pursued with corporate podcasts and which factors are decisive for the strategic orientation of a podcast (size, business model, industry)? What content and quality requirements do consumers make of corporate podcasts? How can corporate podcasts be meaningfully integrated into the content marketing strategy?

Based on real conditions, 'Texcircle' optimizes processes and design and develops specific product cycles. The textile industry is confronted with an increasing volume of used textiles, the so-called 'post-consumer waste', PCW for short, which the end consumer returns after the use phase. This is the classic area of activity for textile recyclers (like Texaid). There are also textiles from overproduction, return goods or liquidation goods that have previously been thermally recycled or destroyed. Due to ecological and ethical concerns, this process is no longer a solution for the Swiss textile industry. This material represents a new market potential for textile recyclers. In the Texcycle research project, the current processing and use of textile PCW was fundamentally examined. In the sense of a feasibility study, the first process optimizations and product concepts for the material PCW could be shown. In the present Texcircle project, concrete solution proposals for the multifactorial challenge of PCW use are being developed in an exemplary Swiss cluster with several partners. The aim is to close the textile cycle within the cluster. The project operates on the three levels of vision, process and product, whereby these levels are promoted in an integrated manner and economic, technical, ecological and design aspects are taken into account. Together with the partners of the cluster, a vision is developed based on existing and developed criteria, stakeholder analyzes and life cycle assessment results. Processes within the cluster are coordinated and innovated with a focus on the development of fine yarns. Finally, high-quality products tailored to the target group are developed. Beyond the cluster, the project shows which success factors and challenges apply to circular PCW processes, which (new) stakeholder roles arise, and which ecological and design criteria are relevant for PCW raw materials, products and processing methods."," Weber-Hansen Andrea,  Willi Benjamin,  Egloff Brigitte,  Wehrli Daniel,  Adler Françoise,  Hügli Joel,  Schmidt Lea,  Häusermann Martina,  Wagner Nora Dominique", Tomovic Tina

The newly founded hospices in particular want to hire specialists from social work in order to be able to cover psychosocial care and support at the end of life more professionally. Many social work professionals who are already working in various palliative care units or hospices in Switzerland are struggling with the fact that it is currently publicly unclear what kind of activities are taken on and carried out by social work. This can also be explained by the fact that this profession is only just beginning to establish itself in the field of palliative care. There is also a lack of in-depth professional networking.

The implementation of the federal government's Energy Strategy 2050 will fundamentally change cityscapes and landscapes. It is crucial that as much of the releasable potential as possible can be exploited. This also includes buildings in the inner cities, which are often in a sensitive environment. The usual black solar modules can usually not be reconciled with the requirements of monument protection and the builder. They are too different from traditional tile roofs (technoid term) in shape and color. Translucent colors and patterns printed on the cover glass of solar modules make it possible to adapt them to their surroundings. However, this process is new and associated with efficiency losses in electricity production and increased production costs. Today's processes for finding colors are poorly suited to the construction process, as they require a long (up to a year) sampling time. In the cooperation on a pilot project with the HSLU - Design Kunst, many parallels to textile design were found. The approaches to color mixing from textile design should be used for the design of solar modules in order to be able to make a precise statement about the aesthetics and efficiency before sampling.

The series of events therefore proposes so-called ""walking think tanks"" at selected locations. Starting with the question of what Baukultur is today, reflexive forays through the built living space are undertaken with technical and everyday experts in order to approach the possible meaning of Baukultur at every turn. Based on the specific living space with its qualities of residence, appropriation and atmosphere, the focus is on today's district development and planning processes. In doing so, we ask about the connections between built living space and planning processes and examine which structural and spatial qualities are perceived by whom and how. What is specifically associated with a high level of building culture and what criteria can this be determined by? The role of the actors involved in the planning process is always reflected. A methodical approach is being developed in order to initiate a dialogue to raise awareness of the topic of building culture as a fundamental indicator of quality of life in everyday life. From the comparison of the quality of the built everyday living space with its planning and development history, the possible meaning of ""Baukultur"" is discussed interdisciplinary with participants from the DA-CH area, including the public."," Zemp Richard,  Kunz Stefan"," Juppien Angelika,  Young Christopher,  Zemp Richard"

The feasibility of this is to be examined in this project. Evaporative cooling is a well-known and effective cooling principle. However, it is very rarely used for cooling buildings. The main reason is the limited low supply air temperatures that can be achieved depending on the humidified air. Instead of this cooling principle, compression chillers, mostly electrically operated, are used, which can provide a lower cold water or supply air temperature. The disadvantage of such compression refrigeration machines, however, is their high electrical energy requirement compared to evaporative cooling. However, as long as no lower supply air temperatures can be achieved by means of evaporative cooling, the compression chiller will remain the most frequently used principle. The aim of the innovative idea is therefore to reduce the temperatures that are achieved by means of evaporative cooling and thus to create a competitive and energetically better system compared to the compression refrigeration machine. The idea is based on the knowledge that the dew point temperature of the air can theoretically be reached by means of an infinite number of evaporation stages. This is based on an existing product in which the air flow from outside air to supply air is cooled in a cross-flow heat exchanger. This is achieved by humidifying the exhaust air flow from the building and bypassing it on the opposite side. In order to achieve lower supply air temperatures, an additional flow of outside air is humidified, which cools down as a result of the evaporation effect and is used to pre-cool the flow of exhaust air. Due to the pre-cooling of the exhaust air, its cooling limit temperature drops, which means that the outside air can be cooled to lower temperatures."," Wellig Beat,  Etterlin Matthias,  Käch Tobias", Kleingries Mirko

The question is relevant because the value-enhancing portion can be passed on to the rental costs. BFE and BWO commissioned a study from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The goals of the federal government's Energy Strategy 2050 and the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 require a significant reduction in total energy consumption per capita and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The building sector in Switzerland should make a significant contribution to this. The necessary increase in the renovation rate requires an increase in comprehensive property renovations. If it is a rental property, the determination of the proportion of value-enhancing investments is of particular importance. Because these costs may be passed on to the residents in the current tenancy. The delimitation of the part of the building maintenance that the previously applicable rent already covers is complex and can represent an obstacle to such construction projects. This also applies to renewals that meet the tenancy law criteria for a major overhaul. Tools for cost triage are in demand Refurbishments are mainly carried out for two reasons: because the technical service life of components has expired and because the social demands for use and comfort have changed. Rentability and user satisfaction make a decisive contribution to the marketability of real estate. Fast and precise costing is essential for the implementation of a management strategy and is therefore an important part of the planning process. Owners and investors must define the proportion of value-preserving and value-enhancing costs in order to be able to pass on the value-enhancing investment to the rent. A cost triage is made more difficult, for example, by diverging renewal cycles and the respective remaining residual values of the affected components. The homeowners' association HEV Switzerland and the Swiss tenants' association SMV have published guides on this. However, there is no tool for cost triage, which was developed in consultation with associations and the federal government. In addition, there are no systematic evaluations that show the effective value-enhancing and value-preserving share in comprehensive renovations. This research gap is closed with the present study. New method developedThe study examined 20 practical examples. The selection has been made in such a way that it is representative of the Swiss housing market in terms of residential typologies, construction periods, property sizes, geographic regions and location. The results of the method developed show that the value-enhancing proportion of comprehensive renovations ranges from 34 to 58 percent. The proportion is therefore tending to be below the pass-through rate of 50 to 70 percent in accordance with Article 14 paragraph 1 of the Ordinance on Renting and Lease of Residential and Business Space (VMWG; SR 221.213.11)."," Amrein Andreas,  Settembrini Gianrico,  Menti Urs-Peter", King Marvin

While Zurich trading houses played a key role in the integration of the Far Eastern country into the world economy, tens of thousands of workers were involved in the processing of silk around Lake Zurich.

The luxurious fabrics reached consumers all over the world via sales offices from New York to St. Petersburg. In order to bypass customs barriers and get closer to customers and sales markets, Zurich silk manufacturers set up subsidiaries in Europe and the USA from the 1870s. With an annual production of over 50 million meters, Zurich was one of the leading centers of the European silk industry around 1900, together with Krefeld, Como and Lyon. From raw materials exchanges to training and testing institutes to the processing industries, a locally anchored and globally networked industry cluster has established itself in and around Zurich. While the Zurich silk industry was still making high profits during the First World War and some companies grew into international conglomerates, the global economic crisis in the 1930s brought heavy losses. With the help of restructuring programs, some of the traditional companies recovered and continued textile production until the late 20th century with specialized products such as clothing, tie and upholstery fabrics. From the 1990s, globalization and de-industrialization led to the closure of the last Zurich silk weaving mills. Textile and commercial service providers as well as other specialists have been able to survive to this day. At the HSLU, a group of historians is investigating the rise, decline and legacy of the Zurich silk industry for the first time, taking into account written, visual and material sources. The basis is a good dozen newly accessible company archives, which are evaluated using economic, social and cultural-historical approaches. The written archives are conserved, inventoried and indexed by the State Archives of the Canton of Zurich, the textile holdings by the Swiss National Museum. The research group supplements archive documents with eyewitness interviews and uses findings and synergies that result from the application-oriented research project ""Silk Memory"". The aim is to publish a comprehensive book on the history of the Zurich silk industry since 1800. The project is funded by the Lottery Fund of the Canton of Zurich and the Zürcherische Seidenindustrie Gesellschaft."," Schmid Claudia,  Ruisinger Denise,  Leysieffer Jonas,  Burri Monika,  Wild Roman", Schwarzenbach Alexis

Drastic social changes and scarcity of resources suggest that today's housing and urban development are under pressure. The resource-saving way of life demanded on all sides will only succeed if we have agreed on new living qualities. Because the latter are not simply proportional to the living space, but are complex and depend on numerous aspects. A different perception of quality of life can definitely go beyond a life that is primarily related to one's own apartment and thus unbundle the well-being from the number of square meters. The care taken in the creation of site- and user-specific living situations and also the urban planning dimension of living are therefore central when it comes to discussing living quality. The assertion that the current housing market continues to propagate a quality of life that is based on traditional views and thus contradicts the agenda of social and ecological sustainability is not entirely implausible. The central question that needs to be clarified is: Which ideas, wishes and needs that the current housing market does not sufficiently cover could be groundbreaking, especially against the background of the required economical use of resources? In which direction do providers of living space have to think and plan in order to invest in such sustainable living qualities?

The issues dealt with also concern Swiss SMEs in particular. For this reason, the state of information security in Swiss SMEs is of great interest to the competence center. There are regularly a large number of reports and studies on various topics of information security. However, surveys that systematically examine the state of information security in Swiss SMEs are rare. The last major survey in Switzerland (not only considering SMEs) dates from 2006. There are more recent studies in Germany, for example a survey by the BSI. Furthermore, a study on cyber risks commissioned by OFCOM and MELANI and prepared in 2015 also takes SMEs into account. At best, a master’s thesis prepared by the University of Zurich in 2015 (“Survey on Cybersecurity and Strategic Defense Measures in Swiss Companies”) also provides interesting information. As part of the present work, a survey is to be carried out among Swiss SMEs regarding the state of information security. The submitted answers are to be evaluated statistically. In addition, measures are to be defined that can help to improve the situation of Swiss SMEs in terms of information security. Finally, the study is intended to offer the participating companies the opportunity to compare themselves with other companies (or within the industry, etc.) in terms of benchmarking with regard to information security.

The application is intended to provide a digital platform that allows every AI player (such as power supply, natural hazards, air traffic, rail traffic, etc.) to carry out a holistic risk assessment, identify the effects of individual events at an early stage and improve networking with a view to jointly an overview of appropriate measures and options for action. Such a ""combination of situations"" for the integration of information and knowledge - and this in real time - as well as joint action does not exist in Switzerland. The use of the application is not limited to AI. The application also allows companies or authorities that are purely market-oriented to identify risks and master crisis situations through integral information management and digitally structured management and decision-making processes, thereby strengthening the resilience of the entire system. The application is intended to help identify critical situations more quickly, gain a better overview of the effects and take more targeted measures. The innovation consists in the fact that the locations of the critical infrastructure in the network (from natural hazards, energy supply, transport routes, etc.) can be analyzed holistically. As a result, interactions and chains within the critical infrastructure can be recorded, assessed and processed more effectively. The recording of the situation is also to be supported by the system integration of bots, scraps and data lakes in order to integrate a targeted procurement and processing of current information and data from a wide variety of sources.

How does the tool have to be designed so that it efficiently contributes to management support in integrated risk management? How can the use of state-of-the-art concepts, technologies and methods for using innovative options in the tool be ensured?

Demographic aging is also presenting society with a number of major challenges in the canton of Uri. Older people want to live in their own environment and in their familiar social environment for as long as possible. However, this is not always possible in Uri: support services (and also nursing homes) are often located in the larger communities in the valley floor, while the small and medium-sized communities have too small a catchment area to be able to run their own support services.

The unique natural and cultural landscape in the Mattertal with the highest mountains in Switzerland, imposing glaciers, extensive permafrost areas and a very high level of biodiversity characterize the life of the local population to a large extent. The federal and cantonal landscape inventories document the special beauty and protection of this landscape. Despite the unique natural and cultural landscape, the Mattertal is confronted with various challenges: Many communities are struggling with migration and a decline in jobs. The occupancy of hotels and second homes is subject to strong seasonal fluctuations. Public funds are scarce, which endangers the functioning of many communities. At the same time, the natural hazard potential is great. Natural resources and traditional cultural landscapes (bisses, alpine farming, etc.) are under pressure. This means that not only is a valuable cultural heritage lost, but also an important potential for tourism. Today, many natural and cultural landscape resources in the Mattertal are hardly known because they are not integrated into the tourism value chain. The tourism potential of traditional irrigation systems, alpine settlements, historical and religious buildings and squares, glacier tongues and cliffs are still underused. In addition, the municipalities in the lower Mattertal can hardly benefit from Zermatt's tourism magnet.", Kühnel-Widmann Fabian, Danielli Giovanni

A rough evaluation should show potential overall counseling concepts (contact point ""one-stop-shop"") for a main study. The energetic refurbishment rate in Switzerland is well below the hoped-for values. If one excludes replacement new buildings, it is even less than 1%. It is well known that owners are hesitant to tackle energy-related measures. Often only brush renovations are carried out, although the financial means for meaningful energetic improvements would be available. The main reason for this is that the expertise hardly reaches the owners. Today there is a lot of knowledge about insulation and building technology, but also about renewal cycles for buildings. However, this usually plays a subordinate role in the decisions of the owners. They are often made without comparing variants and without a long-term horizon, which means that measures with higher initial investments but lower life cycle costs are rarely implemented, even though they would actually be more attractive in an economic analysis. As part of a study for the Federal Office of Energy, the Center for Integral Building Technology of the HSLU, in cooperation with Amstein + Walthert AG Zurich, is investigating the following questions on (energetic) building renewal in Switzerland: • Which energy and building advice models are used in Switzerland or used in Europe? • Which (failure) success factors come into play? • what should models look like that can appeal to private, non-professional builders? The idea of the one-stop-shop is being examined: An owner can contact a central office with all his building and energy questions. All essential questions in connection with the modernization of buildings are dealt with in the regional contact point. Relevant subject areas are renewal strategies, energy, comfort, building physics, insulation, building technology, building law, exploitation potential, profitability, cost planning, funding, project management, etc. In a first project phase of the preliminary study, existing models are used with an approximately analogous approach in Germany - but also in Europe - evaluated in the sense of a desk research. This research is supplemented by interviews with protagonists from the construction sector who operate close to the decision-making mechanisms of private owners. This is intended to examine why the corresponding offers (not) work, or are used well or not at all. In a subsequent step, solution approaches for consulting models to support private builders in renovation projects are to be developed; The focus is on energetic renewal, but should primarily aim at models that cover the entire spectrum of holistic and integral building renewal. Existing advisory, planning and implementation structures must be duly taken into account. At best, the one-stop shop could work closely with planners, experts and craftsmen who are already involved and give them a lot of leeway."," Hincapié Olaya Ingrid,  Domingo Irigoyen Silvia,  Heim Thomas,  Menti Urs-Peter", Settembrini Gianrico

The first phase of life from 0-4 years (birth to kindergarten entry) is formative for later health. With the concept ""Health promotion and prevention in early childhood"" (early health promotion) from 2018, the FOPH wants to strengthen health promotion in pregnancy and early childhood. The concept is based on the national strategies for the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and addiction. Health care for expectant mothers and young families in Switzerland is of a high quality. Cantons, communes, specialist agencies and NGOs are involved in early support: through projects, programs and developing strategies. One challenge, however, is the networking of offers and the accessibility of families in stressful situations - be it due to poverty, addiction, mental illness, single parents or a migration background. One focus of the concept is therefore improving the accessibility and care of these families in the health system. The aim is that all infants and small children receive equal care and thus the same opportunities for a healthy and self-determined life later on. Therefore, the family-centered networking should be strengthened. A measure from the concept of the BAG (cf. pp. 39-40) has set the goal, on the basis of existing initiatives and in cooperation with the canton, of one or more municipalities or a region in the interinstitutional and interprofessional binding networking - in particular at the Interface to health care - to support. For this purpose, the offer of a family-centered network is to be developed, which offers binding professional support for families under stress in the sense of case management and keeps an eye on the interface to KESB. The preliminary study examines how networking projects in Switzerland can be set up and further developed based on the example of early help and other good practice. The following sub-goals are defined: Analysis of experiences in international projects and programs with regard to the use of such models in Switzerland. Analysis of Swiss networking projects and programs including framework conditions with a special focus on families in complex stressful situations. Analysis of national legal foundations that could be of importance for the establishment of family-centred networks. Documenting the needs, hopes and concerns of different actors in early childhood education about their involvement in a family-centred network.

School principals, school social workers and school psychologists in schools and school services were involved. The first empirical study on reports of danger in the school context was implemented in a multi-method approach. From the large number of results, the results on parental cooperation have proven to be particularly concise: There is a tendency to refrain from reporting a risk as long as parental cooperation in subsidiary measures is assumed. This is critical insofar as parental willingness to cooperate is by no means the only factor for successful subsidiary support. This can lead to the sometimes necessary interventions being postponed for a long time by child protection under civil law. The importance of parental cooperation should always be critically questioned in one's own professional actions, in inter- and supervision."," Rosch Daniel,  Gomez-Bugari Katinka,  Gartenhauser Regula", Jud Andreas

For this purpose, we investigate and develop artificial intelligence algorithms for the early detection and prognosis of cardiac arrhythmias from ECG measurements. A focus is placed on the gender-specific differences in arrhythmias. In this project we specifically develop the early detection and prognosis of sporadic atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia based on long-term ECG data (Holter). This can not only save lives, but also prevent serious damage to health and simplify therapies and improve their results. In addition, we develop algorithms for measuring vital body signals such as blood pressure and respiration rate as well as detecting sleep apnea directly from the ECG measurements without additional sensors. These serve the cardiologists for a more comprehensive assessment. No additional sensors are required for the patient. For the early detection and prognosis of sporadic atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, we investigate and develop algorithms based on deep neural networks, which have been shown to recognize ECG traces as predictive markers for the arrhythmia during normal sinus rhythm. We are attempting to use the AI model to record the person-specific and in particular gender-specific differences/variations in the ECG signal, ie signs of a heart attack in the ECG, and thereby enable more precise early detection and forecasts. Specifically, this means that we train the AI with data from a wide variety of people (women/men) so that the AI can cover person-specific variations. For the measurement of the vital signals blood pressure and respiration rate, we investigate approaches based on feature extraction and classical machine learning. All algorithms are developed for long-term ECG measurements (1.3 leads) with a duration of 1.10 days.

The widespread and widespread use of smartphones in Switzerland, the wide range of technological possibilities and the attractiveness of a direct and personal channel offer companies great potential in interacting with (potential) customers - be it for information, communication, transactions or service. Against this background, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, together with the University of St.Gallen and partners from practice, dealt with the question of where Swiss companies and their customers stand in relation to mobile marketing as part of a research project. The aim of the project was to develop a toolbox for the further development of mobile marketing strategies. Benchmark analysis on the company side: In a first step, the status of the company in mobile marketing was surveyed between October 2015 and January 2016 using an online survey. The online survey resulted in a total of 129 questionnaires that could be evaluated. Swiss companies can be assigned to four different levels of maturity when using mobile marketing, with the assignment depending on three factors: the ability to achieve marketing and sales goals thanks to mobile marketing, the degree of individualization of messages and content, and a culture that supports the mobile channel . A mixed picture emerges: 22% of the companies achieve a high degree of maturity and can be described as mobile pioneers. Together with the 33% of companies with a medium level of maturity, they are well on the way to making full use of mobile potential. In contrast, 18% of the companies have a so-called me-too strategy. They try to keep up with the simplest communication offers such as a responsive website or apps. 27% of the companies (lowest degree of maturity) do not use any mobile instruments in marketing. Analysis on the part of consumers: In a next step, a representative survey of Swiss consumers was carried out. The basis for the survey was the company survey, a qualitative preliminary study with smartphone users and the current state of scientific research. The sample included 1,535 smartphone owners of all age groups in German-speaking and French-speaking Switzerland. The field phase took place in July 2016. On this basis, four psychological characteristics were identified that determine smartphone use in everyday life and in interactions with companies. The characteristics are smartphone competence, connection to the smartphone, mobile-specific innovativeness and privacy concerns.

Comparative summaries of all interviews are available in German and English. The clarinetists interviewed in this project have been connected to the so-called Old French School for two, sometimes three generations. Musically, they are the ""grandchildren"" or ""great-grandchildren"" of the French teachers Gaston Hamelin (1884-1954), Daniel Bonade (1896-1976) and Augustin Duquès (1899-1972). Although many national clarinet schools met in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century, the tradition of the Old French School in terms of the parameters ""attack"" and ""voicing"" (translated as ""vocalizing and singing"") is more clearly recognizable today than in the contemporary French school game and teaching practice. After changing the attachment technique, the attachment with contact of the upper teeth on the mouthpiece became established in France around 1950. The ""new"" French clarinet school hardly deals with the traditional double-lipped approach (the upper lip covers the upper teeth). This approach triggers a cascade of muscle activations in the oral cavity that affect the position and shape of the tongue, lower the floor of the mouth, and elevate the soft palate. In addition, activation of the glottis can be observed. For articulation, the tip of the tongue is in a favorable position forwards and upwards in the direction of the tip of the reed and the throat forms as if by itself as a resonance chamber. However, if played with a simple approach (the upper teeth touching the mouthpiece), the constellations relevant for sound and articulation in the oral cavity and in the vocal tract do not appear automatically. They must be realized as conscious vowel formation and additionally as finely nuanced movements of the glottis, through an ""inner singing along"". Communicating the multiple functions that fall to the tongue - articulating on the reed, the simultaneous, independent vowel formation and the formation of a resonance space in the back of the mouth - represents a major educational challenge. Many of the American interview partners therefore recommend familiarizing yourself with the double-lip approach. To explain the technique and to transfer the shaping of the inside of the mouth to the simple approach. The interview partners Richard Stoltzman, Steve Hartman and Thomas Piercy even dared to switch to the technique of the old French school after their master's degree. Researchers have been investigating the shape of the oral cavity and the involvement of the glottis in tone formation since around 1990. The opinions of the interviewees agree with the following research results: suitable vocalization and a fine activity in the glottis increase the speed of the air flow, which favors the speech especially in the upper pitches and allows playing with little pressure. Staccato and legato play improves, dynamics and intonation gain flexibility."," Camp Marc-Antoine,  Kirschstein Natalie,  Kergomard Stephan", Mätzener Heinrich

A comparative representation of the tools is achieved through uniform evaluation criteria, which is supplemented by a coherent evaluation mechanism. In combination with dynamic user ratings, users are able to select adequate technology solutions, make well-founded decisions and optimize their ordering skills. Another added value is the option of selecting technology solutions according to their compatibility with use cases that comply with the Bauen digital Schweiz / buildingSMART Switzerland standards (see also Use Case Management https://ucm.buildingsmart.org/)."," Baldwin Mark,  Weber Markus", Heim Thomas

According to the study, the most intensive commuter relations exist from Dornbirn and Lustenau to Heerbrugg, where large industrial companies are located. In the opposite direction, on the other hand, fewer than 100 Swiss travel via the Alpine Rhine to Austria or Germany. The Principality of Liechtenstein is extremely attractive as a place to work: almost 9,000 people commute here from Switzerland and 7,500 from Austria. The share of public transport in cross-border commuter traffic cannot be specified with sufficient certainty due to the data available; however, it can be estimated at around 5%. As expected, trips to the city center dominate commuter connections between the city center of St. Gallen and the surrounding area. Around 12,000 people travel to the city center every day, around a third of them using public transport."," Schad Helmut,  Solèr Reto,  Diggelmann Thomas", Sonderegger Roger

In contrast to Go or Chess, however, a Jass player does not have complete information about the game since he does not know the cards of the other players. Therefore other approaches have to be used. Various JassBots have been developed at the HSLU that have learned to play Jass with artificial intelligence.

This project aims to make this possible. Most (private) banks have a great interest in knowing the price models and fee structures of their competitors and comparing them with their own conditions. However, it is practically impossible for a bank to obtain the relevant data that is of interest to it. Therefore, this project pursues the goal of benchmarking resp. to include an inventory of regulations in the area of pricing for various private banks and to show the participating banks whether and how the models and, above all, the various prices actually charged by the various banks differ. The planned benchmarking in the area of pricing in private banking is based on the banks' internal figures, which are supplied by the participating institutions themselves in accordance with standardized definitions. This should ensure comparability between the different banks and allow reliable statements. However, the analysis does not disclose which banks have which values.

The project investigates how the pooling rate can be measured and, if possible, improved on the fly. The sustainable development of the transport system, which is the source of the largest CO2 emissions in Switzerland today, can only be achieved through a large number of measures and new technological possibilities. So-called on-demand traffic is one way that the population can be offered an attractive, sustainable alternative to driving their own vehicle. On-demand transport is understood to mean services in which the passenger can order a journey using a booking process, regardless of the timetable. It is crucial that these services open up the possibility for journey bookings from different passengers to be bundled in order to be able to serve similar journey requests in a single journey and thereby save additional vehicle kilometers. In English as well as scientific usage, this bundling of trips is understood as pooling, whereby the term occupancy rate is often used. Basically, it is assumed that the higher the pooling rate of an offer, the more efficient and therefore more sustainable is an on-demand offer and the higher the final degree of occupancy of the vehicle. The pooling rate of shared, demand-oriented transport solutions, so-called on-demand traffic, has so far been a theoretical construct, but it is difficult to measure in the real operation of the mybuxi start-up."," Meschenmoser Philipp,  Vu Thao Thi", Imhof Sebastian

These are evaluated with regard to their effectiveness with the clientele. After-school education and work opportunities for people with severe disabilities are very limited. In many cases, the aspect of care clearly comes to the fore. This fact seems to have historical origins, because people with severe impairments were left to care for a long time because there were no adequate pedagogical concepts (cf. Heinen/Lamers 2004: 14). Klauss (2011: 18) complains that people with severe impairments are often 'merely' cared for, cared for and entertained, and that the aspect of education and development is therefore neglected. People with severe impairments do not only need nursing and care, but also a pedagogically designed everyday reality in which the quality of life can develop (cf. Fornefeld 2003: 82). The Wagerenhof Foundation tries to meet this requirement by designing the adventure rooms – a job offer especially for people with severe disabilities. The offer offers clients with severe impairments the opportunity to experience themselves acting, to experiment, to explore the environment and to experience basic sensory experiences. The focus is on everyday experiences and individually designed movement and activity offers with various materials in order to develop skills and abilities and to get in touch with the environment. This offer of experience rooms is evaluated in a multi-stage process in cooperation with the Intercantonal University for Curative Education. The following questions guide the evaluation: - To what extent are the dimensions of education and development conceptually anchored and to what extent does education and development take place through the activities in the experience spaces? - To what extent do the activities in the adventure rooms promote communicative skills? - To what extent do the activities in the experience rooms encourage meaningful work, occupation and activities? The evaluation aims to provide an overview of the effects in the areas of education, development and quality of life as well as to point out possible need for optimization with regard to the conceptual design and the implementation of the activities in the adventure space. Against the background that there is little empirical knowledge about job offers for people with severe impairments, a first initial project is being started with the evaluation of the adventure spaces of the Wagerenhof Foundation.", Georgi-Tscherry Pia, Calabrese Stefania

Against the background of social change and with a view to continuing to optimally fulfill the public educational mandate, concepts for quality assurance and development were introduced and the external profile of the music schools was strengthened. Among other things, the employee appraisal (MAG) was introduced as an important management tool and work was carried out to improve human resources. In the field of music education, for example, concepts for periodic attendance of lessons and for adult learning were created. A central area of development included the creation of synergies at the various organizational levels. For example, the internal training courses and the opening conferences were jointly planned and carried out. By means of targeted media work, the external profile of the music schools could be significantly strengthened."," Huber Jürg,  Camp Marc-Antoine", Brand Marc

The late-Gothic Church of St. Oswald in Zug houses various historically significant organs; the history of these instruments was worked up in the early 1990s. In the meantime, however, numerous sources have emerged that cast this story in a new light. In 2012, the cantonal preservation of monuments in Zug published a monograph on the Church of St. Oswald. The Hochschule Luzern - Musik was asked to contribute a contribution to the monograph on the history of organ building, in which the newly found sources were evaluated. The Church of St. Oswald in Zug is one of the most important late Gothic buildings in Central Switzerland. The church not only occupies a special position in terms of art history, but also has a rich musical history, which shows special features in several respects. Suffice it to say here that St. Oswald in Zug, along with the Fraumünster in Zurich (1479), the Bern Minster (ev. 1483) and the Basel Minster (ca. 1474), is one of the very first churches in the Confederation, the one Owned an organ with a Rückpositiv (St. Oswald 1482). In 1602 the city of Zug employed Hans Brunner from Basel and in 1633 even an organ builder from Ravensburg (Hans Ulrich Riegk). In 1760 the city council ordered a large organ with 2 manuals, pedal and 26 registers for the church of St. Oswald from the most important representative of the well-known organ builder dynasty Bossart from Baar. The history of the organs in St. Oswald was already researched by Josef Grünenfelder as part of the cantonal organ inventory (1990-92). This resulted in a general publication in 1994 on the inventory of instruments in the canton (Grünenfelder 1994). This leaves several questions unanswered (for example, the exact location of the first instruments in the church). In the meantime, several previously unknown documents were discovered as a result of the reorganization of the Zug Citizens' Archive, which are now available for renewed research. The planned publication of a new monograph on the Church of St. Oswald Zug by the Cantonal Monument Preservation Office will be used as an opportunity to conduct a complete study, based on various sources, of the various organs (main and choir instruments) that played in this important church to attack.",, Brandazza Marco

Interdisciplinary planning processes are the key to this - for this it is important to prepare and convey content-related and methodical knowledge. The increasing complexity in the planning of buildings is driving the specialization of the individual subject areas. This often leads to communication difficulties, immature buildings, and increased costs. It is therefore important to bring together specialist knowledge at key points in the planning process. This is the only way to design integral buildings that are planned and built as part of a comprehensive system. This reduces energy consumption, leads to a need-based use of technology and enables the optimization of gray energy. Many of the specialist publications available today have a highly disciplinary perspective and convey a high level of detailed knowledge. However, the cooperation of the different disciplines and the definition of the content-related connection points are hardly reflected. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts would like to launch this project to advance integral building planning. Better and more efficient solutions for our buildings can only be developed through outstanding interdisciplinary planning. The aim of the project is to develop content-related knowledge about the building as a system, but also methodical knowledge about integral building planning in the cross-section of research, teaching and further education and to convey it in three formats: A reference book is intended to provide knowledge in the education and further education of students and professionals convey the conception of integrally conceived buildings. A symposium is intended to promote active discourse on topics relating to the building as a system and to document the findings in a conference proceedings. A digital platform provides the stage for the reference book and the symposium. At the same time, it is used to present projects by students and researchers. Knowledge can be comprehensively offered and continuously updated. These three formats provide important basics for developing competence in the building as a system and integral building planning. The focus is on the fact that the energy issue in the construction industry must be approached in an interdisciplinary manner. For example, through targeted cooperation, the specialist planners can optimize the use of material and thus save gray energy. This is also a decisive factor with regard to the necessary transformation of the building stock into a sustainable future."," Altenburger Adrian,  Wieser Christoph,  Geissbühler Dieter,  Schultz Elke,  Schwehr Peter,  Stoian Ralph,  Kunz Stefan,  Heim Thomas,  Rieder Urs,  Teutsch Uwe,  Sigrist Viktor", Geier Sonja

The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences accompanied the dialogue phase with a formative evaluation. The urban land policy is confronted with a fundamental conflict: the desire to live in the cities is increasing and at the same time the building land is becoming scarcer. The resulting increasing pressure on the underused mixed-use and commercial areas close to the center has often led to such areas going into the hands of investors and the possibility of participation, design flexibility and spatial ties for different user groups on site has been eliminated. The Industriestrasse project shows how the course of such urban development processes can be influenced by the civil society commitment of the actors concerned. A cooperation between five different building cooperatives has set itself the goal of maintaining existing qualities and defining new qualities in a negotiation process with the involvement of the spatial pioneers who are already resident. This requires new forms of process design and a planning culture that not only includes but also recognizes civil society commitment. The ITC project, which was designed as an accompanying research, evaluated and documented factors that promote and hinder this cooperative planning culture from the establishment of the cooperation up to and including the competition and so-called dialogue phase (before the realization of the construction project).

The most important sustainability labels specify the life cycle costs LZK as a mandatory indicator for new buildings, as does the Swiss Sustainable Building Standard SNBS, a valuable sub-instrument for implementing the Federal Council's energy policy and sustainability strategy. Various tools with different approaches are available to determine the life cycle costs (LCC). These are partly based on a quantitative method (e.g. IFMA tool) and partly on a qualitative assessment (e.g. LZK tool of the Canton of Berne, SNBS for smaller buildings). Despite the recognized quality of the tools, architects and project developers still have high reluctance to use them because the effort required for a comprehensive assessment can seem cumbersome and the added value of the analysis is not immediately identifiable. The LZK calculation using the IFMA tool, which is mandatory for larger SNBS projects, is usually only carried out by proven specialists. Minimizing the effort when architects, specialist planners, builders or investors first approach the LZK using a simplified and lean LZK approach therefore seems crucial. Ultimately, it would contribute to an increased application of a sustainable LZK consideration and thus to the sustainable development of the building stock. The integration of the new LZK approach in the SNBS would also promote an increase in the number of certifications. The aim of the project is the formulation of a simple, comprehensible approach to the LZK consideration. With a relatively small expenditure of time, through selected information on the profitability of a construction project and by answering simple questions that can also be understood by inexperienced users, concrete statements on the LZK of a construction project or a variant analysis should be able to be created. From a sustainability point of view, less relevant investments should be identified and avoided in an early phase of the construction project, or necessary measures can be initiated. The desired LZK approach should be based on the proven properties of the existing tools. With the work, proposals for its adaptation - in the sense of a simplified application - are delivered.

The scientifically documented organ history of the canton of Uri is only known in very general terms to this day. Instruments are said to have existed in the canton of Uri as early as the threshold of the 17th century. Since the Uri valleys did not have any local organ building workshops until the middle of the 18th century, various craftsmen from different backgrounds worked there, which resulted in a rich variety of instruments. The branch in Altdorf in 1783 by Franz Joseph Bouthillier (1737-1828) from Dinkelsbühl in Germany, who built two large organs in the parish church of Schwyz and in the monastery church of Einsiedeln, was important for the organ landscape in Central Switzerland. Johann Joseph Jauch, born in Isenthal in 1808, also ran a popular workshop in Altdorf. The situation changed towards the end of the 19th century, when modern organized organ building companies from other cantons assumed a certain monopoly position in the churches of Uri: the Goll company (Lucerne) between 1893 and 1936, the Cäcilia company of Alfred Frey (Lucerne) from 1958 until 1970 and later the Mathis company (Näfels), which built the youngest organ in the canton of Uri in the parish church of Bürglen in 2016.

The transformation of the communication markets that can be observed and the changes in the communication behavior of consumers have extensive effects on the planning and implementation of communication in companies. On the strategic-planning level, the current shift in power to control communication messages and, in particular, media distribution away from the company to the collective leads to the need for a further development of previous communication concepts. The classic inside-out planning concepts must be supplemented by outside-in perspectives in order to take account of the changed role and power of the former communication recipients. The diverse communication options and the existing uncertainties also require adaptable communication planning in order to be able to react quickly to changes. The overarching research question addressed by the project is to find out how the content of communication planning can be further developed at a strategic level against the background of the digitization of communication and which organizational, structural and system-specific measures are necessary for its implementation.

The availability, topicality, completeness and quality of the data determine the visibility and business success of tourism organizations and service providers. The future development and competitiveness of the Lucerne Lake Lucerne Region is to be strengthened through data-based, more objective decision-making at all levels, ie authorities, tourism organizations and individual service providers. The overarching long-term goal of the project is the step-by-step establishment (ie planning, development and commissioning) of a Central Swiss Tourism Observatory (ZTO), which makes the data relevant to tourism available and usable. Systematic surveys, analyses, data and their processing and above all their integration serve as a basis for target group and market decisions, the development of offers, the management of guests on site and the associated strategic control and regulation. Since 2018, the Institute for Tourism and Mobility has been involved on several levels and as part of various projects in developing the basis for a gradual development of the ZTO for the region. In order to achieve this objective, an interdisciplinary team is working on the following sub-goals as part of this project: On the one hand, a business model is to be developed and, on the other hand, a system architecture is to be designed. In addition to the design of the cooperation relationships with the relevant partners, the focus is on the development of a pilot application, which serves as the basis for submitting an application as a third-party funded project and as a draft for the further development of the ZTO. Subsequently, a concrete application example is to be implemented as a prototype as proof of feasibility of the conceptual system architecture. Furthermore, cooperation is to take place with the university's existing ""Smart Region Lab"" (https://sites.hslu.ch/smartregion/) so that the ZTO prototype can provide the data basis for their innovative data visualizations. Thus, the technical concept is already empirically supported. The Central Swiss Tourism Observatory integrates the observations obtained from the frequencies, movements, outputs, etc. from various sources in an innovative and reliable platform. The central Swiss data infrastructure for tourism (ZeDIT) serves as the technical basis for this. On this solid foundation, the observatory fulfills two core tasks. On the one hand, products tailored to user needs are offered, which contribute significantly to the financing but also to the further development of the ZTO and are strongly driven by demand from the private sector and the public sector. On the other hand, the processed data is used for knowledge transfer and knowledge acquisition in training, consulting and research."," Wyss Lucienne,  Zimmermann Luzia,  Wyss Melanie", Stuber-Berries Nicole

We are talking about the transition zone between the facade of a multi-party apartment building and the sidewalk on public land. This layer, which is often only a few meters wide, has to cope with a whole range of functions, meanings and the resulting interpretations. It is the membrane between anonymity on the sidewalk and security in your own home. Every (urban) culture develops its own system of architecturally mastering the transition from public to private space. Wherever the cross-section of the street permits, the buffer zone of the front garden was already established in the first building regulations at the end of the 19th century. Over the decades, it has emancipated itself from its original use as a ""spacer"" and in places has developed a life of its own. The front yard takes on a very specific kind of ""personality"" that is shaped by the individual and collective personalities of the residents, as well as by a common sense that does not allow for any extravagance in the city. At the same time, the front garden is and will remain a part of the public space, at least it is connected to it spatially and visually. Anyone who strolls through the streets knows this continuum of very different front gardens, which contributes significantly to the overall impression of a street. The project investigates the phenomenon of the front garden in urban space, taking into account various aspects such as the visual appearance, its (use) use and appropriation as well as the importance for the associated building itself and the ""neighboring"" public. The research question is: What is the significance of front gardens in public space for both residents and the public? How are the different claims negotiated and regulated? Which social ideas shape the regulation of the front yard zone and which actions are associated with the appearance and existence of front yards? By means of regular research walks in the two cities of Zurich and Basel, a photographic fund is created, the continuous evaluation and structuring of which leads to an independent artistic work. In addition, there is historical, urban planning and architectural research on the nature and value of the front garden in architectural history and the present.

This preliminary project, together with the planning office Metron, examines the potential of augmented reality (AR) as a creative and planning visualization and design tool in a first practice-oriented step. Based on the planning practice of Metron and a selected case study in Disentis, it is examined as an example which AR visualization forms make the most sense for which target audience at what point in the project. In close cooperation with the practice partner Metron, the first prototypical solutions are being developed using AR. For this purpose, the following questions should be answered based on Metron's planning practice: At what points in the project does the use of AR make sense? Which degree of abstraction of AR visualization is best suited for which project status? What does a planning process have to look like in order to be able to benefit as much as possible from this new AR tool? Augmented Reality has great potential for visualization: spatial situations can be visualized on site. So far, particularly final project visualizations at the end of the planning process have been examined and developed using AR. AR visualization and design options at the beginning and in the course of planning processes have so far hardly been taken into account, which is why there are no practical approaches in this area. This preliminary study is intended to show the technical feasibility and assessment of AR as a visualization tool in an early and visionary project status.

This preliminary project, together with Nomoko AG, examines the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) combined with Nomoko's digital twins for a better participatory planning process in urban and community development. At the heart of this idea is the recognition that AR applications have the potential to enhance spatial awareness and create immersive experiences that can be shared in real time and overlaid on top of reality on-site. The practice-oriented development and research takes place on the basis of a practical example in Unterägeri ZG, in which the town center is upgraded with various residential and commercial buildings as well as public spaces. As part of the planning work, Nomoko created a photogrammetric 3D model of the village center, a so-called digital twin. High-resolution photos, which Nomoko took with a camera drone, serve as the basis for this. The HSLU team is exploring the collaborative interface potential of Nomoko's digital twins with location-based and mobile AR applications. It should be possible to view different construction methods and typologies on site in AR linked to information and representations from the digital twin. In the interactive AR environment, the viewers can also “build” their own modular buildings in a participatory manner in order to be able to independently design and discuss different variants. The two areas of digital twins and augmented reality have so far been developed and researched independently and isolated from each other in the context of urban planning processes. In addition, previous methods of participatory planning processes in urban and community development usually rely either on on-site processes, ie on site and analogously, or on online processes that enable participation independent of location and time. Integrated systems, on the other hand, are used less frequently. The bundling of the departments of Nomoko (digital twins) and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (AR) makes it possible to evaluate the interface of these two up-and-coming technologies in an initial practice-oriented feasibility study."," Schnellmann Christian,  Schneider Christoph,  Lanfranconi Dario", Matter Tobias

With his company Idealheim in Basel, he decisively shaped the furniture design and living culture of the 50s and 60s internationally. Dieter Waeckerlin (1930-2013) was one of the most important Swiss interior architects and designers of the 20th century. After graduating from commercial school and completing an apprenticeship as a carpenter, he shaped living in Switzerland and Germany with his furniture and the interior design company Idealheim. He produced his own designs in the carpentry workshop he took over from his father and sold them together with other major furniture brands in the store on Rümelinsplatz in Basel, which he owned until 1982. The most important works include the first mobile wall cabinet with sliding doors for WK-Wohnen, his sideboards for Behr International, the round chair for Walter Knoll/Cassina, the invention of the diagonal solid wood panel material for Dietiker Möbel and the Saffa lamp for the Swiss exhibition for Women's work from 1958. Dieter Waeckerlin was also a pioneer of digital design and the first Swiss designer to design his furniture with CAD from 1986. Dieter Waeckerlin found widespread recognition in Germany in the 1950s to 1970s, where he was able to place his products in the collections of leading furniture companies such as Behr International and WK-Wohnen and Walter Knoll. This is probably also the reason why he was hardly noticed as a designer and interior architect in Switzerland and why he still does not experience the importance that his outstanding work deserves.

Instead of testing a connection based on hypotheses using a sample, algorithms run over large amounts of data and look for connections. Even if this topic is pushed in theory, the implementation in practice is only hesitant. This may also be due to the fact that many controlling departments are only in the process of expanding the database before they run the first predictive or prescriptive analyses.

The European Horizon project ENFLATE is making an important contribution with a platform for trading with electricity flexibility. The flow of electricity is changing as a result of the expansion of renewable energy sources. However, the network that has to handle this is still the same and not designed for it. That's why flexibility is needed, especially during peak periods. Flexibility describes the ability to ramp up or down power consumption depending on the situation on the grid. The trading platform used as part of the ENFLATE project should make this possible: ""Anyone who knows that they don't have to charge their electric car at a certain time should be able to sell this flexibility on the ENFLATE platform,"" explains Christoph Imboden, a lecturer at the university Lucerne. Electricity providers then have the option to interrupt charging and make the electricity available to someone else. ""We want to know if this can work."" For this reason, the offer is to be set up in a sample district in eastern Switzerland as a test. For Jürg Solenthaler, Head of the SAK Network Division, this approach has great potential: “The fundamental restructuring of the Swiss energy system over the coming decades will have an impact on the individual distribution grids. The network operators have to be prepared for this – for this reason we are also a member of the European research project. With this sub-project, we look forward to examining the effects of flexibility markets on network utilization in practice.» Philippe Vassilopoulos, director of product development at the European power exchange EPEX SPOT, explains: “Supply and demand are brought together in one market in the most economically sensible way. The neutral reference price, which is transparently determined by the electricity exchange, creates the right incentives to optimally use flexibility in the electricity system.» The project does not want to reinvent the wheel, but to build on existing platforms. As part of the 48-month European project, comparable platforms are being tested in different countries. ENFLATE brings together a consortium of 30 organisations: transmission system operators, distribution system operators, market operators, regulators, service providers, manufacturers, academia and stakeholders. The aim of the members is to promote clean energies in Europe, reduce the costs of the energy transition and increase its economic benefits. Ultimately, ENFLATE aims to provide the means for effective control of electricity exchanges at regional, national and European levels, improve communication between decentralized energy sources and stimulate the sustainable development of new cross-sectoral business models that leverage consumer/customer participation in low-cost electricity trading.

Since the space between the facades is protected from dirt, it does not have to be cleaned. Thus, this offers the optimal position for shading and light control systems or even for photovoltaic elements. Since photovoltaic elements are increasingly being arranged in the facade area, it makes sense to integrate them into a CCF as a combined energy generation and shading system. It should therefore be examined whether the usability of the PV[1] elements is guaranteed in closed double-skin facades and what additional requirements result from this. In a first phase, the individual CCs develop the basics and boundary conditions for the feasibility study, which is then developed in a second step in interdisciplinary cooperation. The goal is to bring a holistic CCF system with integrated PV to market maturity in a third phase.

Electric vehicles can be used to compensate for short-term peaks in the power grid by feeding power back into the grid from the car batteries (called Vehicle2Grid or V2G) Through the use of renewable energy sources, electricity is produced irregularly and consumed more irregularly, for example through fast charging of electric cars or the use of heat pumps. In order to have any amount of energy available for it at any time, massive investments would have to be made in the expansion of the power grid. For example, with the construction of new power plants. Alternatively, the energy provided can be increased for a short time by either switching off large consumers or feeding electricity into the grid. One speaks here of so-called control energy. A well-regulated power grid can compensate for peak loads without the need for grid expansion. Balancing energy is now mainly supplied by electricity supply companies, which feed energy into the grid for short periods using generators. Another participant in the control energy market are so-called aggregators. Aggregators are companies that have access to a large number of similar, electrically powered devices. So-called bundles. These bundles can be switched off at the same time to compensate for peak loads in the power grid. Typical devices for such bundles are currently boilers or heat pumps. If the grid operator reports a need for control energy, an aggregator can switch off 5,000 heat pumps within seconds, for example, and thus relieve the load on the electricity grid. This project is investigating whether electric cars would generally be suitable for forming bundles and feeding energy from the car batteries into the power grid within seconds if required. This approach is called “Vehicle to Grid – V2G”. At the same time, it is being examined whether a ""Vehicle to Grid"" business model can be economically interesting. The aim of the project is the evaluation of a communication standard which, within seconds of being requested by the network operator, allows the aggregator to communicate with the operator of a charging station network, the charging station itself and the vehicle. The request must be able to be sent through the entire chain in fractions of a second so that the balancing energy is in the network within seconds. In addition, the data must be absolutely secure against access from outside and privacy is a high priority."," Paice Andrew,  Camenzind Martin,  Friedli Martin", Rumsch Andreas

Often built on what was then the outskirts of the city, they are being prepared for more diverse uses in the future through approaches to hybridization. Due to the shortage of living space and the low potential for densification in the cities, the pressure to transform is growing, especially on the stock on the outskirts. If density and diversity are understood as fundamental urban qualities, what is needed above all are measures that promote the variety of uses and changeability of the typology of large settlements that are widespread here and make a contribution to further developing the edges in a way that makes them connectable. The research project ""Hybridize the Ordinary"" explores the question of how the urban quality and transformation capacity of large settlements on the outskirts can be increased with strategies of ""hybridization"" so that they are suitable for current and future society. ""Hybridization"" is characterized by strategies that promote multifunctionality, synergetic orientation and adaptability of the built living space. This creates opportunities for action in times of uncertainty. The research project shows that large housing estates not only provide a large stock of apartments with affordable rents, relieving the housing market, but also points to the importance of large housing estates as a resource for the further development of today's urban landscapes, in particular for the application of the concept of dense mixed use outskirts and a new understanding of sustainable housing development."," Hansch Franziska,  Franke Julian,  Frommenwiler Leonie,  Schwehr Peter,  Zemp Richard,  Lutz Selina,  Bucher Stefan", Schuchert Christian Lars

The social crisis resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic made it clear in many communities that current strategies for dealing with social challenges (demographic change, care, loneliness) are no longer sufficient and will no longer be able to be financed in all parts. A need for action is diagnosed, to reassess existing potentials in the communities and to use and coordinate them more optimally. The “We make community” project assumes that unused potential in communities lies in the administration itself and in the population. These assumptions were discussed and validated with community clerks on the basis of formulated theses. For this purpose, workshops and short and detailed interviews were carried out at the beginning of 2021. Based on the discussions, it is determined that there is a need for a cultural change in public administration. It includes turning away from the principle of responsibility and towards process flows, more openness, social participation and the ability to innovate. This means a change in culture, away from an administrative culture towards a “design culture”. This change in administrative culture must be reflected in its interaction with the population and civil society. This means improving the coordination and cooperation between the administration and the population / civil society and the framework conditions for civil society engagement in the communities. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, socio-culturally sound examples of support and flexibilization of commitment could be observed, which can be understood as a model for comparable projects. The contribution that a socio-culturally sound approach to the interface between administration and civil society can make became clear. By means of dialogue, understanding, joint learning processes and consensus building between various relevant groups of actors (e.g. administration, associations, population, etc.), broad-based solutions for the complex challenges of the present and future are to be found in the future."," Durrer Eggerschwiler Beatrice,  Näther Caroline", Petrusic Ivica

Due to the rapidly advancing networking and ubiquitous nature of IT, more and more movement data is being recorded. In order to be able to open up new sources of income, telecom companies such as Telefónica are planning to market anonymized transaction data from their customers. Another example is SBB, which is developing an app that will guide travelers to platforms, shops and toilets in stations. The general terms and conditions of this offer allow SBB to create movement profiles and to address customers with ""advertising information or surveys"". However, if the location of rail customers is refined and the movement profiles become more and more precise, this could be legally problematic. In order to comply with legal restrictions, only anonymized transaction data can be used, which is completely separated from personal information such as name and telephone number. Other information, such as age and gender, can only be used if no conclusions can be drawn about the person. However, the latest investigations have shown that in a data set, such as is generated by any mobile phone provider (i.e. relative distance between the radio cell antennas and a location entry approximately every hour), with only four known data points time/location about 95 percent of all people can identify. This could be, for example, the address of private residence, work and geo tags of tweets or images. In recent years, it has been recognized that absolute anonymity is difficult, if not impossible, to ensure. The necessary knowledge to recognize possible attacks is also missing. As potential link tables become more prevalent, the risk of single and fishing attacks continues to increase. With good security, the quality of the data usually drops considerably - especially for indefinite evaluations, as is the case with the publication of open data. On the scientific side, various anonymization methods and measures have been developed for tabular data, such as k-anonymity - protection against linking of identities, and l-diversity - protection against the disclosure of attributes. However, as explained above, movement data has an even greater «potential» to reveal the identity of people. This is even more true for trajectories. First measure of anonymity, such as B. LKC-Privacy, are currently being developed. Scientific work that explores algorithms taking into account utility for the recipient is just beginning.

Due to ongoing innovations in relation to digital work and organizational tools, work requirements and conditions are constantly changing (Meissner, Weichbrodt, Pretty, Baumann, Klotz, Pekruhl & Gisin 2016). The flexibility, speed and innovation requirements for companies and their employees increase in proportion to the digital transformation. New forms of organization are emerging, which are characterized by rapidly changing organizational boundaries and newly defined employment relationships. Knowledge workers in particular are confronted with a progressive flexibilization of the work culture due to their work content. In this context, so-called labor companies face major challenges in terms of their self-management. Constant availability and the resulting constant need to communicate, teamwork when physically separated and constant distraction are stressors that can have a negative impact on the performance and thus productivity of employers if there is no self-management that is appropriate to the situation. Furthermore, inadequate self-management often leads to incompatibility between different areas of life (e.g. work, private life, hobbies), which can sometimes be reflected in loneliness and isolation and/or significantly increase the potential for conflict in the respective areas of life (Hill, Ferris, & Märtinson, 2003) and is a long-term health hazard. Where a culturally created boundary between work and “leisure” was previously cemented by the spatial and temporal demarcation of wage labor, this has recently been softened by the newly acquired digital sovereignty (Lepping & Palzkill, 2017) of the individual and opened up a variety of individual options for action . In the way of life, the task of drawing boundaries, if this corresponds to a personal need, is transferred back to the individual and challenges them to manage these boundaries using type-appropriate and stringent boundary management in such a way that a boundary congruence arises, which both their own and the meets the needs of the relevant stakeholders. This is the only way to ensure a healthy and productive lifestyle.

While the living room is increasingly finding its way into the office, the home today is also an office and work space. The clear assignment of functions to rooms and locations has become obsolete in many areas today, since activities such as working, living, consumption and production are overlapping and the previously rigid boundaries of space and use are dissolving. We live in the age of «both-and» and no longer in the age of unequivocal «either-or». The simultaneous and network-like replaces the sequential and hierarchical. The future of spaces is therefore characterized by ambivalent functions and possible uses. The Soft Space can be understood as a response to this development. At the 2nd International Interior Design Symposium, everything revolves around the dissolution of borders: be it in terms of usage, between public and private or between inside and outside.

Life in an inpatient setting can harbor potentially difficult situations for people due to various institutional and personnel requirements. Due to cognitive and communicative limitations, this is particularly true for people with cognitive impairments. In this context, socio-educational counseling is of great importance. It is advisory action in the complexity of problem situations and problem-solving strategies. However, socio-educational counseling is hardly institutionalized in the handicapped assistance and integrated into the everyday life of the clientele. So far, a specific concept and action model for the socio-educational counseling of people with cognitive impairments in an institutional setting is also missing.

What can lead to considerable economic damage for companies and private individuals often proves to be a major hurdle in the collection of information relevant to the case in the area of official criminal investigations. In a first project (competence development CC Cryptology I), the IWI has the competencies for the work built on this topic. The focus was on the one hand the clarification of the demand for services in the field of cryptology for official investigative bodies, but on the other hand also the technical possibilities of implementation. Ambiguous statements can be made about the achievement of goals. On the one hand, the infrastructure was successfully set up and put into operation. In addition, various test runs of the infrastructure were carried out. Not as planned as part of a pilot phase for public authorities, but with user login and password analyzes for three different companies (NTLM) and the Internet service LinkedIn (SHA1). On the other hand, the strategic decision of the Institute for Business Informatics at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to end the IT forensic activity naturally had a major impact on the achievement of the goal of “expanding the range of IT forensic services” which, as a result, became obsolete. The tests so far have shown that with the new infrastructure a remarkable performance can be achieved when cracking various hash values. Passwords (e.g. NTLM hashes) up to a length of 8 characters are not a problem. After that, it may be worth using an optimized character set, since many special characters are very unlikely to occur. Due to the performance of current graphics cards, all eight-digit passwords can be used (NTLM hashes) can be recovered in a short time with very little financial outlay. Therefore, eight-digit passwords are no longer sufficient to ensure adequate security. It is advisable to set a minimum password length of 10 characters. It becomes difficult if the hash value was generated using PBKDF2, bcrypt or SHA3. Even increasing performance by a factor of 100 would not bring about a noticeable improvement. Due to the abandonment of the IT forensic activity at the Institute for Business Informatics at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, the further use of the results and, in particular, the infrastructure that has been set up is uncertain."," Kurmann Dominic,  Schupp Dominik,  Tuccillo Maurizio", Hirschi Oliver

A resource that has so far been little explored is the plant residues from banana production. This raw material is being researched in an interdisciplinary team.. project in the “Science & Design” field of activity of the Gebert Rüf Foundation This raw material is being researched in an interdisciplinary team and assessed with regard to its suitability as a fiber material for textiles and composites. Since the available cultivation area for cotton is limited and competes with food production and the raw material oil for the production of synthetic fibers is finite, new resources for the production of textile fibers have to be developed and researched. These resources should be sustainable and allow long-term use without negative ecological consequences. A previously little explored resource for textile fibers are the waste products of banana production. This results in banana trees from which fibers can be obtained that offer great potential for applications in the interior and upholstery fabrics sector as well as for clothing. Banana fibers have an elegant light yellow-white color and, as a natural fiber, complement the limited range of organic cotton. Banana fibers have good textile properties similar to other natural fibers (e.g. linen fibres) and can also be processed as technical textiles together with synthetic and natural resins to form composites that are used in the sports sector (e.g. skis, snowboards, bicycles) and in the transport sector (e.g. molded parts and fittings for cars, buses, airplanes) are used. This project is about analyzing the necessary processes for the production of textile yarns from banana waste. The pulping and yarn production should take place as close as possible to the cultivation areas. Fiber and yarn samples are produced and examined together with partners from India, Brazil and China. Based on the results, the designers and plastics technologists define the requirements for pure banana yarns and threads, or possibly for blends with other natural materials, which are knitted and woven in Switzerland. (Jute fibres, for example, are suitable for mixtures, which in Switzerland are used almost exclusively in the garden area and which could be refined with banana fibres.) The production and design of fabrics, knitted fabrics, technical textiles and molded parts for the European market takes place in Switzerland, where there is already a great deal of know-how in the product design, implementation and use of natural materials. The interdisciplinary cooperation between design and technology enables the development of holistically conceived products that are both functionally and aesthetically convincing. The cooperation of the three differently oriented institutions enables a comprehensive view of the research field, encircles the area from different points of view and makes it possible to show an extended range of fields of application. Together they create functional, aesthetic, emotional and symbolic added value through the design and development of new products."," Weber-Hansen Andrea,  Khalsa Chhail", Moor Christina

This also applies to online food retailing in particular. well-tried trade and marketing adage is: Acquiring new customers is a lot more expensive than keeping existing customers. This also applies above all to the online food trade, where, due to the still prevailing skepticism of the population, high sums are spent on acquiring new customers as a percentage of the shopping cart value. However, the challenge in e-commerce in general and especially in e-food is: keeping existing customers for as long as possible and skimming off customer lifetime value. Despite recurring order frequencies, retailers often do not manage to encourage new and occasional customers to place repeated orders and keep them in their own universe. The respective cohort is therefore smaller. Instead, high marketing sums continue to be invested in acquiring new customers, often without achieving lock-in effects and increasing customer lifetime value. The project identified influencing factors from literature and commercial practice to increase customer loyalty and order frequency in e-commerce.", Georgi Dominik, Schu Matthias

This is where NudgeIT's approach comes in, with the creation of a new type of digital support assistant for knowledge-based questions. A hybrid approach is chosen in which questions that can be answered with explicit knowledge are handled directly by the application.

The company Texaid Textilverwertungs AG is confronted with the problem of developing ecologically, economically and socially sensible circular interorganizational processes (intralogistics/interlogistics, production, distribution) with the old clothes. She wants to use the opportunities of digitization to do this. Since this topic affects the entire industry, the Swiss Textile Association ""Swiss Textiles"" supports this project. The idea of this project is to examine to what extent agile business models and digital processes / tools can support the transformation of the textile chain towards a circular economy. The thesis is that agile business models such as sharing, repairing, etc. can change consumer behavior and change the textile industry, which is geared towards growth, in the long term. Digital processes and tools make it possible to promote traceability and transparency in the processes and to establish the trust of consumers and those involved in the process."," Willi Benjamin,  Egloff Brigitte,  Moor Christina,  Schmid Claudia,  Minonne Clemente,  Adler Françoise,  Schmidt Lea,  Korner Leonz,  Huonder Michael,  Weingärtner Tim", Weber-Hansen Andrea

At the same time, new uses induce additional traffic, which has to be handled on existing or new traffic infrastructures or offers. In addition to these superficial system connections, however, there are even more far-reaching interactions. In particular, the location and development as well as the structure of the settlement areas (density, mix of uses) essentially determine the travel behavior of residents and employees. At the same time, new infrastructures induce additional traffic by covering greater distances. Due to spatial planning specifications and goals, the future settlement development should no longer take place ""in the area"" at new locations, but should primarily be covered within the existing settlement area. Inner development and settlement densification are the central requirements of future spatial planning. In addition, the densification should not take place everywhere, but in the sense of coordination between settlement and transport at the central locations that are well served by infrastructure and public transport. This means in those areas where the transport infrastructure is limited and already heavily used and in many cases already overloaded. This poses new challenges for traffic planning, but also for the development and approval of densification projects. New solutions are required. In general, but especially in the case of densification projects, an adapted traffic behavior of future users must be promoted and achieved. There are already various approaches to this, such as travel models, mobility management, etc. In addition, the legal basis and the practice of building permits must be further developed. Evidence of adequate development, as required by the building laws, is difficult or impossible to provide, particularly in the case of motorized private transport when the road networks are busy. As a result, the spatial planning objective of densifying settlements runs the risk of failing due to the implementation and approval of corresponding projects. A key aspect of this topic is the agreement and coordination of the planning stakeholders (authorities, investors, etc.). On the one hand, the cooperation between the administration and the private actors is of interest, on the other hand, however, the coordination of the departments involved in the administrations - especially across the level structure of the community and the individual institutionalized planning instruments - is of interest. In addition, questions arise regarding the support of the projects from the idea to the realization and operation of the areas and facilities. These questions are to be examined within the framework of this SVI research project."," Mahrer Matthias,  Vu Thao Thi", Ohnmacht Timo

Energy transition in Switzerland is lagging behind expectation despite highly advanced technologies. To ensure energy transition, innovation in the energy sector must tackle complex multilevel and often controversial (`wicked`) issues. The International Energy Agency calls for a more systemic and collaborative approach to innovation and knowledge sharing. Municipalities act as mediators in the innovation process. They can promote energy innovation by involving all relevant actors at municipal level in a process of co-creation. Our TFV-Networking Event Series ‘MUNICIPAL: Co-Creating Energy Innovation at Municipal Level Across Regions and Sectors’ provides municipalities across Switzerland with access to energy innovations. After identifying stakeholders, issues and challenges in the Swiss regions, we employ a design approach to co-creation to enable stakeholders who otherwise compete to explore controversial issues together and to arrive at both innovative project ideas and a new capacity for working co-creatively on energy challenges. Consequently, this series not only facilitates development of innovative energy solutions at municipal level, yet it connects relevant actors from groups including (among others) industry, R&D, policy makers, administrations, citizens and civil society in a multi-stakeholder-process to build an open-innovation community with focus on energy transition. The community is expanded stepwise across regions and sectors over the course of the series.

Possibilities of innovative living and working uses are examined that take into account the interests of the actors involved. Ground floor zones are an important part of buildings, but also of the cityscape. Restructuring processes in trade, the growth of online trade, social and cultural shifts in values, but also legal framework conditions are causing a functional change in the ground floor locations. Distinct vacancies and underused business and retail space are omnipresent and a visible expression of this change. At the same time, there is increasing demand for residential areas close to the city center, which have the potential of a lively and heterogeneous cityscape. The PARTERRE project examines how vacant ground floor areas in inner-city areas can be converted and revitalized as a place to live and work. It is also about the question of how a change of use affects the quality of life and stay of the city dwellers and how the interfaces between public city life and private living can be designed. The project takes into account the entire structure of effects with the interests of the various actors and develops a sustainable and future-oriented conversion strategy for empty ground floors."," Hanisch Christoph,  Moser Eveline,  Kleczka Katharina,  Gmünder Markus,  Müller Meike,  Wolf Michaela,  Amstutz Sibylla,  Mück Ursina", Hartmann Nicole

Experienced yodelers in the region around the Alpstein have an impressive repertoire of yodeling melodies that they can clearly distinguish, name individually and call up at any time, but those who are unfamiliar with them may say: ""They all sound the same"". The type of polyphony, the slow tempo and the repeated yodeling syllables make it difficult for outsiders to recognize the structure and form of individual melodies. Since yodelers from this area are able to easily differentiate between a large number of yodeling melodies that are similar in shape, the question arises as to whether they use special listening and memorization strategies. This question, together with the fact that yodelers pass on the melodies orally, makes the singing and yodelling culture of north-eastern Switzerland interesting for music-cognitive research. Since the processes of differentiation and memorization of melodies take place individually, both consciously and unconsciously, the present study combines music-analytical approaches with the results of ethnomusicological field research. The results presented here help to understand the cognitive aspects of yodeling in the Alpstein region and to use them as discussion material in current music cognition research. In the last twenty years, yodelling has become popular beyond the region under study. Many people find their own yodeling voice through various offers such as courses, workshops, concerts; The present study provides interesting points of reference for the developing yodeling pedagogy."," Kammermann Andrea,  Camp Marc-Antoine,  Wey Yannick", Ammann Raymond

In current residential construction, individual floor plans and the design of the facades are of great relevance. Less dealing with the spaces in between - the area close to the apartment and the wider living environment. They mark the transition from the private to the public and serve a wide range of communal uses. Today, in urban areas, the optimization of use and the planning concentration are in the foreground; the “in-between”, on the other hand, increasingly threatens to be devalued to “quantité négligeable”. This is where the project comes in. The project wanted to strengthen the perception of the threshold and intermediate spaces in the living environment and promote the creative dialogue between the various protagonists. Particular emphasis was placed on a process-oriented approach intended to stimulate action in practice. Three events were designed as on-site explorations with expert discussions.

These surveys served as the basis for the subsequent development of studies in which various questions relating to the financing situation of Swiss SMEs were answered. The fifth survey is to be carried out in autumn 2016. The results of this survey are of particular interest as the economic environment has changed significantly since the last survey in 2012.

An example is the information flow analysis as protection against side channel attacks. Information theory is applicable whenever a probability distribution is known. This is rarely the case in the security sector. Information algebras form an alternative that can operate with weaker assumptions and therefore allows more realistic scenarios to be considered in the security area. The aim is to develop an SNF project to introduce information algebraic techniques in information security. The second part of the project focuses on the evaluation of inference methods with customer preferences and their application in e-commerce.

Evidence-based in addiction prevention is a major challenge. Not infrequently, the magnitude of this challenge comes with an unclear understanding of what 'evidence-based' entails. An HTA report (Health Technology Assessment) on the status of alcohol prevention in Germany (Korszak 2012) came to the sobering conclusion that only one percent of the 208 alcohol prevention projects examined can be described as 'evidence-based'. This alarming finding came about because the term 'evidence-based' in the HTA report was equated with methodologically correct proof of the effectiveness of these prevention projects. In fact, only 2 of the 208 projects examined were able to provide this evidence. Equating 'evidence-based' with 'proof of effectiveness' results in prevention being completely overwhelmed. In addition, this equation is not semantically correct, since 'basing' refers to existing knowledge and not to knowledge that is to be collected (Hoff et al. 2014). Furthermore, evidence-based prevention can only be compared with evidence-based medicine to a very limited extent, as is often done. And finally, for methodological and/or cost reasons, it is not possible to provide proof of effectiveness in many (not to say most) prevention projects. From this point of view, it makes sense to limit the concept of evidence-based solely to the reference to the available knowledge from science, practice and target group and to use this evidence as a basis (evidence-based) for the planning, implementation, anchoring and, if necessary, dissemination of prevention projects to use. This should be distinguished from the generation of new knowledge in the course of the project. This knowledge can emerge from the evaluation of the project impact on the final target level (eg prevention of addiction); however, this is not the only target dimension that can be evaluated. So it can make sense to examine the effect of the measures on the individual influencing factors or to evaluate other aspects such as the quality of implementation. In the report, the body of knowledge at the individual levels should be presented and theoretically located. In addition to presenting the available knowledge on the different stages of cannabis prevention and regulation, the report aims to explain how the stage model works and to provide research tips for practice organizations that do not have a lot of resources and knowledge to acquire and generate knowledge and still improve the quality of their projects.", Müller Marianne, Hafen Martin

Experiments in space have shown that certain biological processes behave differently under weightless conditions than under the influence of gravity here on earth. Interestingly, cells or cell clusters grown under such conditions behave much more like endogenous cells than those grown in conventional, stationary Petri dishes. This makes such cells particularly interesting for research. The Micro-Gravity Incubator (MGI), developed in cooperation with the CSEM and other competence centers, consists of a random positioning machine and an incubator. The Random Positioning Machine, or RPM, consists of two nested rotors: the outer rotor turns the inner rotor or rotors, which also turn. This double-gimbal design means that the direction of the sensed gravity vector is constantly changing. With a suitable control of the rotors, it can be achieved that the average gravity vector averaged over time tends towards zero and thus leads to simulated weightlessness."," Haack Carsten,  Vonäsch Jonas,  Amstutz Lukas,  Egli Marcel,  Müller Marcel,  Reyes Perez Mariana,  Provini Markus,  Gilgien Pascal,  Berger Tobias", Koller Adrian

Flags are mainly used today as an advertising medium. The demands on the flagpole product have risen sharply due to the associated increase in flag sizes. Flagpoles are exposed to great stresses due to the effects of the wind, the calculation of which is hardly known in the industry. The aim of the project is to develop optimized and customer-specific flagpoles and thus bring a new generation of products onto the market. In order to achieve this, the theoretical basis for a situation-related dimensioning as well as a needs-based production of the flagpoles must be developed and integrated into a web-based configuration module, which allows customer-specific solutions to be offered and thus assume a pioneering role in the industry."," Koller Adrian,  Christen Benno,  Fleischli Bruno,  Provini Markus,  von Burg Martin,  Gilgien Pascal,  Wili Patrik,  Staubli Thomas", Bärtsch René

Flagpoles are exposed to strong wind loads, the calculation of which is hardly known in the industry or at least has great uncertainties. This makes it difficult to select the optimal product tailored to the customer's needs and occasionally leads to damage, the causes of which often remain unclear. According to the state of the art, wind loads on supporting structures are defined by the standards known in civil engineering. On the one hand, the calculation process described therein proves to be too complex for a manufacturing company and, on the other hand, there are sometimes great uncertainties in the influencing parameters to be selected. In a preliminary project, the influencing factors necessary for the stress on the flagpole are identified and their relevance for the selection of the product is quantified by means of a parameter study. Measurements on a flagpole at the HSLU are used to check the theoretical relationships and are intended to show any uncertainties in the influencing parameters. An application for the main project financed by the CTI is formulated from the findings of both the theoretical and the experimental investigations."," von Burg Martin,  Staubli Thomas", Bärtsch René

It has long been found not only on isolated social media platforms, but also occurs on messaging services such as WhatsApp, or in the comment columns of high-quality online news portals. Currently, content on FDI is checked manually by users or employees of the social media platform, messaging service or news portal. The aim of this project is to identify characteristics of FDI. Field reports show that FDI often have the same characteristics in terms of the language, images and formal aspects used. FDI are often emotional with very positive or negative sentiment and strong emotional intensity. In addition, FDI posts or comments indicate an explanation gap in a topic and thus create a need for explanation, which is often accompanied by uncertainty.

Artistic research as a contribution to the development of current spatial configurations for the moving image. The project examines artistic film practices that present moving images beyond the cinema hall. Two artistic research projects examine spatial concepts in art exhibitions and in urban space in which film/video have established themselves. Filmic forms are also increasingly found outside of the cinema. In terms of film and art history, spatial works with film can be related to the expanded cinema of the 1960s, but today they are based on new conditions: the digitization of film, the much smaller technology, networked and almost ubiquitous screens, increasingly widespread virtual and augmented reality technologies but also through our habituation to moving images in everyday life and the resulting changes in how we deal with media content. The project ""Moving in Every Direction"" (MIED) examines current forms of artistic installations with moving images in exhibition and urban space in two artistic sub-projects. The questions of the project include, among other things, to what extent artistic installations with moving images convey an experience that (not) corresponds to watching conventional films, and which changed approaches artists (in terms of spatial planning, narration, and possibly the immersion of the audience) in order to plan and implement such installative film works. At the same time, in an act of self-observation, the project documents one's own work in the artistic research process. In this way, it wants to make a contribution within the framework of the fundamental and ongoing change in contemporary film and media studies, in which spatial paradigms are increasingly coming to the fore and the practice of artists is brought into the formation of theories.

Early parenthood is associated with an accelerated and premature assumption of roles, for which young people are insufficiently prepared in their development. A particularly problematic aspect is that the risks associated with early parenthood are passed on from one generation to the next. The greatest burden for young mothers results from the balancing act that has to be mastered every day between family and education, which often goes hand in hand with mental and physical overload situations. The precarious educational situation of young mothers means that, without suitable support and funding offers, they are much more likely to remain without a vocational qualification than women without children, or to achieve less qualified vocational qualifications much more frequently.

This must be proven before the label is handed over by means of a measurement result (blower door measurement), whereby limit values must be observed. The international standard EN 13829 permits different variants with regard to air permeability measurement methods. Therefore, in January 2007, the Minergie association published the “Air permeability measurements in MINERGIE-P® and MINERGIE® buildings” (RILUMI) guidelines. So far, this has worked well for residential buildings. However, the RILUMI is only suitable to a limited extent for the Minergie-P categories (non-residential buildings) that were newly defined in 2009, and individual measurement methods have to be defined again and again, for example for large buildings. In order to be able to investigate the most pressing problems in this regard, the SFOE project was extended by one year and some objectives were redefined. A main topic of the project was the proof of the reproducibility of the measurements of residential buildings. For this purpose, a round robin test was carried out with 6 measuring teams. The results have shown that the deviations are within an acceptable range using the RILUMI as a basis. A workshop was also held with experienced measurement experts, in which various measurement-related topics relating to non-residential buildings were discussed. The relevance of various standard specifications was also discussed. Since there are no empirical values for the tightness of ""critical components in non-residential buildings"" (sliding doors, roller shutters, etc.), several measurements were carried out as part of the project.

Galleries must learn to live with the fact that images are now being transmitted, shared and negotiated on networks, and that these images are held in a new physical state on social media. In it, superimpositions of production and manipulation, of individual and collective production of meaning, replace the traditional static processes of representation and memory. Curatorial authority no longer emanates from a particular center and cultural institutions need to relate the viewpoints of their previous stakeholders and advocates to the competence of social media curators. Current practices of disseminating and presenting images need to be re-examined with regard to larger audiences than the usual audiences of museum practices. In particular, institutions entrusted with genuine digital photography must put the prevailing ideas of 'curating' to the test. The networks of online culture open up new possibilities for exchange with the public (co-authorship, participation) and marketing (added value, interaction). The project is use-inspired. In international cooperation (Lucerne, Winterthur, London, Barcelona), it connects museums of art and culture with the network of online culture and produces new academic as well as practice-based curatorial knowledge as a key contemporary practice.

In the building, the self-consumption of solar power is optimized, the PV system output is limited and consumption peaks are reduced. Buildings with a limitation of the reference and feed-in power at the lowest level (16 A fuse) would be attractive buildings for power grid stability. Limiting the connected load would mean a significant reduction in the load on the power grid. As a result of the limited feed-in power, the building owners would optimize their own solar power consumption with a PV system, limit the PV system power, reduce the consumption peaks with load management and possibly install a power storage unit. The idea of limiting the purchased and feed-in power through permanently installed hardware seems to contradict the idea of energy networking in the sense of a ""smart grid"". Due to the different interests of the stakeholders, it is not yet clear what advantages and disadvantages a 16A building would have for the various stakeholders. It has also not yet been examined what the technical possibilities for implementation are and whether or under what circumstances a 16A building can be economically advantageous. The project goals are: The concept of the 16A building is examined using simulations for a wide variety of variants and scaling and the technical benefits for the stakeholders (network operators, building owners) are presented. A technology evaluation shows necessary developments for the practical implementation of the 16A building. A white paper shows pros and cons for changing user behavior towards energy efficiency in the 16A building. A broad public will benefit from the implementation of the concept of the 16 A building in the form of stable power grids and more renewable energy in the power mix with low costs for grid expansion and system services."," Sotnikov Artem,  Zweifel Gerhard,  Vetterli Nadège,  Menti Urs-Peter", Sidler Franz

The subject of the project is the voluntary commitment of older people, which is part of the formal commitment. This form of engagement mostly takes place in the context of organizations and associations. In the cases we examined, the volunteers are organized into (work/project) groups or committees that meet regularly for meetings or discussions. Participation in working group meetings and the communicative activities in the meetings are not only time-consuming, but are themselves a constitutive part of the commitment. For this reason, the focus of the project was placed on the communicative know-how of the volunteers and the communicative interaction in the groups, and the interactive activities in work group meetings were empirically examined. The results from the empirical part of the project were then prepared for practice and reflected on in a workshop together with representatives from practice. In the project, the practical achievements (the know-how of the volunteers) but also possible areas of conflict and the role of older people in the implementation of voluntary commitment are presented using the example of working group meetings.

So far, there are no reliable figures on the extent of violence against older people. According to the WHO (2015), in middle- to high-income countries, 2-14% of older people are affected by violence. Even higher rates are assumed for people with dementia and people in care facilities. The Independent Complaints Board for Old Age (UBA) estimates that 300,000 older people in Switzerland are affected (Somaini, 2013). However, a high number of unreported cases can be assumed, as many cases go unreported. In postulate 15.3945 (Glanzmann-Hunkeler) ""Preventing violence in old age"", the Federal Council is commissioned to prepare a report that shows the extent of violence in old age. The application was accepted in June 2017. The report is prepared by the BSV. It is intended to serve as a basis for taking suitable measures. In December 2018, the Lucerne School of Social Work was commissioned to carry out the study. It aims to clarify what is meant by violence in old age, how widespread the phenomenon is in Switzerland, what preventive and intervention measures exist and how these are to be assessed (including early detection). Finally, on the basis of the findings, possibilities for improvement with regard to the prevention of and intervention in cases of violence against older people should be identified."," Reichlin Beat,  Bannwart Cécile,  Bloch Lea,  Portmann Rahel,  Gretler Heusser Simone", Krüger Paula

Globally increasing environmental awareness and economic cost pressure motivate companies to treat electrical energy as a valuable commodity and to promote efficient use. At the same time, the European Union issued guidelines for increasing energy efficiency. An increase in energy efficiency in industrial companies often requires a very complex analysis of the current situation. The estimated costs for this are often so high today that companies refrain from doing so. Therefore, Camille Bauer Metrawatt AG (CBM) is convinced of the idea of a simple and cost-effective load breakdown for industrial companies. With the previous project ""NILM@I - NILM for industrial applications"" we have already researched a possible solution for a cost-effective analysis using Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) in the industrial sector. NILM enables load breakdown based on only one central power measurement. The project had shown that use in industrial companies requires higher accuracy and better applicability than is possible with classic NILM processes. In NILMplus we now aim to explore a new approach to load breakdown. Thanks to the combination of NILM algorithms with easy-to-install, inexpensive current sensors, this should bring the required accuracy with better applicability. These current sensors should be able to be attached to a load's cable without having to disconnect it from the mains and thus provide information about switch-on/switch-off events and load jumps. We expect that this additional information can massively improve the accuracy of the load breakdown. With NILMplus, industrial companies can be offered cost-effective energy monitoring according to ISO 50006. Thus, not only existing customers of CBM should be addressed, but thanks to the USP, a number of new customers worldwide should also be convinced."," Calatroni Alberto,  Rumsch Andreas,  Paice Andrew,  von Arx Dieter,  De Assunção Pestana Edgar,  Li Ehu,  Kniesel Guido,  Kaufmann Lukas,  Vogel Manuel,  Camenzind Martin,  Friedli Martin,  Bosser Thomas", Huber Mittler Patrick

In the study, players are observed over a period of 12 months with regard to the influence of the suspension and are questioned in writing. Gambling can have serious consequences for those affected and can lead to psychological and social stress and even addiction to gambling. In Switzerland, games of chance are regulated in the Federal Law on Gambling (BGS). The casinos are obliged to exclude players from gaming operations who they know or must assume, based on their own observations or as a result of reports from third parties, that they are: a) overindebted or unable to meet their financial obligations or b) place stakes that are not in any in relation to their income and assets (paragraph 1). Players can apply for a game suspension themselves from a casino or an organizer of major games that issue game suspensions (paragraph 5). This ban extends to land-based and online casino games, as well as the major online games organized by the two lottery providers. In a study by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, people who were banned from gambling in Swiss casinos and online casinos were excluded are, observed. They were questioned in writing about their gaming behavior at three measurement points six months apart. At the same time, persons who were not blocked were interviewed. Showing the differences between the banned and non-banned individuals allows conclusions to be drawn about the effect of the ban on gambling on psychosocial health, gambling behavior, counseling motivation and financial conditions. The baseline survey shows that there is a significant association between status (banned n =87 and not blocked n=259) and indicators of the debt situation and symptoms of gambling addiction. In the course of the three surveys, 242 players took part in the survey. Of these, 33 people were blocked during the entire survey period, 76 people were blocked or not blocked at at least one measurement point and 133 people were not blocked at any time (control group). Although the gambling ban was circumvented by some people, a significant reduction in gambling frequency, gaming duration, expenses and the severity of the gambling addiction symptoms could also be demonstrated in those who were only temporarily banned. The effects are significantly greater for the players who were banned during the entire survey period. Finally, it should be noted that 12.1 percent of the banned persons stopped gambling altogether during the survey phase. The results should help to improve the regulation of gambling bans as a measure of player protection."," Steffen Angela,  Regli Flavia,  Wallimann Hannes,  Amenda Ina,  Mathys Jacqueline,  Schwarz Jürg,  Wegelin Philipp,  Kessler Seraina,  Kergomard Stephan", Lischer Suzanne

The experiment goes into space as part of the REXUS program Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that has also strongly influenced the development of life. Many animals and we humans have organs that allow them to orientate themselves in space using gravity. With the beginning of manned space travel, it became clear that weightlessness, also known as microgravity, has drastic effects on the body and individual organs. Amazingly, microgravity not only affects organs, but also individual cells. To date, it has not been fully clarified how cells can perceive external forces. In addition to other proteins, it is assumed that mechanosensitive ion channels in the cell membrane play a crucial role. The team from Lucerne therefore wants to investigate how these channels behave under microgravity conditions. The massive muscle and bone atrophy that astronauts suffer from, especially during longer space flights, can also be observed in older people on Earth. For this reason, space is an excellent mechanobiological laboratory to study such changes. A team of students from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts wants to fly a biological experiment on board a sounding rocket as part of the REXUS program. The team proposed using frog eggs to study the effect of microgravity (weightlessness) on mechanosensitive ion channels. REXUS stands for Rocket Experiments for University Students and is a training program of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). Student teams can apply for a spot on one of the two sounding rockets launched annually as part of this program. Since the Swedes open their share to all member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Swiss students can also take part in this competition.

The project shows how dynamic spatial models contribute to understanding these relationships. Limit values for sound levels only very incompletely reflect the acoustic spatial perception of those affected. Scientific / physical approaches cannot explain why different outdoor spaces with very similar sound exposure are perceived completely differently. Even the inclusion of sound space research (Maag & Bosshardt, 2012) or perception psychology cannot explain many of the observed differences. Dynamic spatial concepts offer explanations that do not understand the (acoustic) urban space as a territorial space – in the sense of a container – but as a complex structure of interacting elements (cf. Lefèbvre 1974; Löw 2001; Rolshoven 2003). Using the example of the Kleinbasel Rheinbord and the MFO Park in Zurich-Oerlikon, an attempt is made to view the space in these three dimensions using participatory observation, interviews with key people from the city administration and an analysis of existing fundamentals and literature. Interesting aspects emerge: The residents of the Basel Rhine bank are probably affected by higher noise levels and more constant background noise than those at the MFO Park, but more acute conflicts and an aggravated situation can be observed in the latter. The Rheinbord is considered to be one of the most important public spaces in Basel, while the MFO-Park is seen more as a courtyard in a housing estate than as a public space. In addition, the banks of the Rhine are used willingly and intensively by broad sections of the population, including many residents. In Zurich, on the other hand, there is a conflict between residents and young people. The importance of the dynamic room concept for understanding the differentiated perception of noise can be shown well with these two examples. In a very simplified way, the three levels can be illustrated as follows with the case studies: Representational roomAssignments are made to each room. These are all the stronger, the longer the ascribed properties have had time to anchor themselves in the collective consciousness. In Basel, this is the Rheinbord as a place of rest and leisure for everyone. The MFO Park, on the other hand, is perceived more as the inner courtyard of a housing estate. These attributions shape the response to sounds. Experienced spaceThe experienced space has a lot to do with the personal attitude towards a noise source. If, for example, as a resident I use the outside space myself, the noises of others usually bother me less. Built room This describes the room in its planned function and the noise according to the physical laws. The legal protection against noise acts on this level. Due to the quantification, limit value considerations are possible."," Nägeli Bettina,  Fanghänel Ilja,  Müller Meike,  Gäumann Simone,  Kirchschlager Stephan", Steiner Thomas

A checklist is intended to provide practical instructions on how to deal with conflicts of use. Grün Stadt Zürich is responsible for the planning, design, care and maintenance of greenery in public spaces and municipal properties, but especially parks and green spaces. It is precisely there that conflicts of use manifest themselves again and again. It is a demanding task to meet the different requirements as far as possible and at the same time to ensure that the high quality of the systems and their maintenance are maintained. In the case of green spaces, conflicts of use do not only arise between different claims for use; in addition, the excessive strain on the lawns, etc. limits the use of the facilities. With the strategy, the ""green book"", the park concept, the park manual and numerous other models, strategies and guidelines, there are already a large number of specifications for the planning, implementation, maintenance and use management of parks and green spaces in the city of Zurich.

Hasliberg is one of the tourism communities affected by the second home initiative. Since it was accepted, no building permits have been issued for second homes. The negative effects of the initiative are consequently a marked drop in orders in the local construction industry and the threat to the associated jobs and training positions. These developments could result in emigration and worsening of the village's economic situation. As part of the interdisciplinary focus on tourism and sustainable development at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, a situation analysis was carried out as a preliminary project. In addition to many potentials, this also revealed challenges. There is no lively village center that is available as a meeting place and offers small businesses commercial space. Most of the hotels on offer no longer meet current and future requirements. The occupancy of the second homes is insufficient and the number of overnight stays in the hotels outside of the high season is low. What is needed is an innovative overall strategy and a repositioning of the community that builds on its strengths and leads to sustainable community development. After initial preliminary work and the development of the project organization, the population and all stakeholders were invited to contribute ideas and to supplement or enrich the existing sub-projects. In particular, the owners of second homes were made aware and activated. In this way, sub-projects and measures could be defined in several fields of action, which were bundled in an action plan. Working groups have been formed for the following fields of action, which are developing the corresponding measures: - Trade/construction/timber construction - Intergenerational living - Village centers - Owners of second homes - Hotels/catering/secondary hotels - Tourist infrastructure - Agriculture - Mobility - Youth - Overarching measures The first short-term measures are information occasions for homeowners who are willing to renovate with the participation of the local construction industry, the founding of the ""Netzwerk Hasliberg"" development association consisting of locals and owners of second homes, and the development of a digital platform for the community and all visitors.

These statements, which are based on estimates, are checked in the present main study. The intention was to use detailed calculations (CFD simulation) to determine the heat loss via the single-pipe circulation for the most common functional openings. A catalog was created from this, with which the specialist planners can easily take the heat losses into account. The results from the main study now show that the heat losses via functional openings as a result of single-pipe circulation are not as great as the preliminary study suggested. According to the present study, depending on the circumstances, the heat loss is still up to 5% of the total heating requirement of a detached house. The heat losses can be reduced by approx. 50% by installing 25 mm pipe insulation. Another important factor influencing heat loss is the diameter of the functional opening. The heat loss increases disproportionately with larger diameters. This means that it is essential to avoid oversizing during planning.

In this project, we examine how organizations identify their talents and what contextual factors drive these decisions Challenges related to macroeconomic volatility, social inequality or health are currently increasing pressure on companies and threatening their ability to attract and retain talent. As a result, talent management has become one of the priorities for CEOs. However, surveys show that less than a third of companies that do talent management are getting a significant return on their investments in identified talent and that almost half of talent nominations fail. In this project we therefore look at the foundation of talent management from the perspective of the paradox theory. We propose to view talent identification as a pluralistic and dynamic process rather than from the perspective of a traditional static best practice approach. Two studies are envisaged: First, we create a typology of tensions in talent identification to understand how companies manage these tensions. We then conduct a two-stage survey of companies in Switzerland to examine how companies' approaches translate into proximal and distal talent management outcomes. Additionally, in both studies, we examine the contextual factors that explain why companies take different approaches to talent identification. The project is carried out as a cooperation between the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) and the University of Lucerne (Unilu). dr Anna Sender (HSLU) leads the project and is supported by Dr. Lea Rutishauser (Unilu) and a doctoral student.

Conventional dishwashers require a large amount of high-quality electrical energy, with the largest share being used to heat the washing water, dishes and tub. The heating takes place with an electrical resistance heater. It therefore makes sense to implement measures to reduce the need for electrical energy in the area of heating. In this KTI project, a heat pump for dishwashers was developed so that the need for electrical energy can be reduced. The entire system is heated by heating the process water in the condenser of the heat pump. The evaporator is embedded in a latent heat accumulator. Due to the use of the enthalpy of solidification during the phase transition, the size of the heat source can be minimized. As an additional measure, a drying process tailored to the heat pump was developed, which positively influences the efficiency of the heat pump by reducing the internal temperature rise. With these measures, the demand for electrical energy can be reduced by 30-50% compared to today's commercially available series devices."," Casartelli Ernesto,  Mangani Luca,  Gasser Lukas,  Hoffmann Sebastian,  Maranda Simon,  Flück Stefan,  Käch Tobias,  Birrer Werner", Wellig Beat

This project explores how the bass and drums contribute to the groove effect in western popular music. Background If, when listening to music, one experiences the involuntary urge to bob one's head to the beat, snap one's fingers, tap one's foot or dance, music psychology speaks of the groove effect. The causes of the groove effect are still largely in the dark. Previous research suggests that the clear perceptibility of a regular groundstroke plays an important role because it enables movement coordination in the first place. Other results show that rhythmic interest and the listener's musical taste are relevant because they motivate movement. This project tests existing groove theories against drum patterns and bass lines in Western popular music: drums and bass are the primary beats in this repertoire, and they contribute greatly to rhythmic interest. Aims The project creates detailed audio reconstructions of 500 iconic bass line/drum patterns from popular music. The reconstructions are used in listening experiments to test the influence of bass and drums on groove. The project investigates the influence of musical taste on groove using a newly developed style questionnaire. It tests a comprehensive groove model that the project team developed as part of the previous project (SNF No. 162504). Significance Movement stimulation is a fundamental effect of music on people. This project is basic research that contributes to a better understanding of this phenomenon. The groove effect has an important field of application in sports: millions of people use music every day to motivate and regulate the intensity of endurance training. However, the effect is also used in music therapy, especially in the therapy of neurological diseases that impair motor skills (e.g. Parkinson's)."," Hoesl Florian,  Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Jerjen Rafael,  Bechtold Toni Amadeus", Senn Olivier

Background and goals Some addiction prevention offers, structural and behavior-oriented measures to prevent problematic behavior and the consumption of psychoactive substances in children and young people, are aimed specifically at families. With the approach of family-related addiction prevention, socially disadvantaged, so-called socio-economically disadvantaged families in particular should also be reached. Parents/parts and children in these families are exposed to particular stress due to precarious living conditions. In addition, these families with a high need for prevention and health promotion are still poorly reached. Some barriers that make access to addiction prevention care more difficult are known (financial deprivation, language, etc.). However, the interaction of these barriers and the emergence of ""difficult accessibility"" from the perspective of the affected families and their living environment are largely unexplored. The aim of the present study is to reconstruct which constellations and (living) circumstances among socio-economically disadvantaged parents and their (pre-)adolescent children in German-speaking Switzerland lead to a more difficult use of addiction prevention offers and projects. As part of the qualitative study, 36 problem-focused interviews were conducted with parents and their children aged 10 to 14 years. The interview transcripts are evaluated using theoretical coding according to Strauss and Corbin (1996).

An examination of these traces should contribute to clarifying the difficult term ""craft"" and shed light on the potential impact of production on the physical structure of buildings. Does manual production really leave specific marks on the building? Handicraft is increasingly being pushed aside as the predominant production method in construction, so are the traces of production changing and with it the architecture itself? In the project, the term – craft – itself is first to be defined in terms of its importance for architecture; a valid definition for the collective process of building does not yet exist. The investigation is based on the analysis of built case studies. Five structures constructed in wood form the primary sources for examining the methods of manufacture. This view of manufacturing from the point of view of its physical product means that the traces of manufacturing are not considered independently of their origin. In this way, the case studies show different strategies for dealing with traces of production as a means of architectural expression. Haptics, physique, materiality and construction logic still play a major role (and are currently increasing in the context of technical developments) in the work of architects and in the assessment of architecture, so that this work can contribute to the understanding of current and fundamental architectural phenomena ."," Geissbühler Dieter,  Unruh-Bodin Tina Henriette,  Dusseiller Yves", Herres Uli Matthias

A History of Technology and Fashion in the Swiss Silk Industry, 1880 – 1914 This research project analyses design processes in the Swiss silk industry from 1880 to 1914 and is a contribution to the international history of design. History of design has so far primarily been practised within the frameworks of art and cultural history. Focusing on the Swiss silk industry this project argues, however, that design has much to gain from being analysed within the framework of the history of technology. Understood to be a process rather than a product, design shaped all stages of production – from research and development to distribution and marketing – of the fashionable textiles which Swiss companies made for markets around the globe, from New York to St. Petersburg. In the second half of the long 19th century the silk industry, specialising in broad dress fabrics and based in the region around Lake Zurich, became one of the largest sectors of the Swiss economy with an annual turnover of more than 100 million francs. This project argues that this growth was due not only to the price but also to the design of the silks produced. Being the most expensive and luxurious of all traditional fibres, silk was much more linked to high fashion and conspicuous consumption than were cotton, linen or wool. And just as in this period Paris-based high fashion not only established itself as a global trendsetter but also evolved ever more rapidly and unpredictably, only manufacturers who were able to create textiles in line with the latest fashions could hope to succeed. The archives of the Zurich silk industry show that the flexibility of the design process was the key to successful manufacturing. On the one hand, extensive textile archives not only served manufacturers as references, marketing tools and a source of inspiration for new designs. They also contained a wealth of information and know-how, thus enabling the rapid (re-)creation or adaptation of any type of textile or pattern – no matter how innovative the design was or how long it had been out of fashion. Written records, on the other hand, not only reveal a complex network linking factory owners to external service providers such as dyers, marketing experts, freelance designers and commodity traders; they also show that confidence was derived from a high degree of flexibility in the design process because this allowed for quick reactions to changing international fashions. The empirical base for this research project consists of the archives of more than a dozen Zurich silk manufacturers recently transferred to public collections. Analysing these archives within the framework of the history of technology, this research project scrutinises the role of actors, tools, places and discourses shaping the very processes by which the Swiss silk industry arrived at designs fit for a global luxury market. Since April 2016 this research project is undertaken by Denise Ruisinger in a joint PhD between Lucerne University and ETH Zürich.", Ruisinger Denise, Schwarzenbach Alexis

High quality of living is symbolized for many people by the single-family house. In combination with the constant population growth and the associated increasing need for housing, this contributes to the fact that around eleven hectares of agricultural land are sealed every day in Switzerland. For future-oriented actors, both municipalities and providers (property developers, architects, investors), it is therefore necessary to create an offer that reduces urban sprawl and is optimized in terms of living quality so that it can come up with qualities similar to a single family home. In this sense, the aim of the CTI project was to transfer the quality of living attributed to the single-family house to the multi-family house or its immediate living environment. For example, a distinction was made between social, psychological and spatial advantages, as well as between real and supposed advantages. The following sub-questions were answered in the project: Which preferences are decisive when choosing between a single- and multi-family house? Which criteria for the planning and implementation of apartment buildings can be derived from this? How can the advantages of multi-family houses with single-family house qualities be communicated in a targeted and addressee-oriented manner? The products resulting from the project were decision-making and planning aids for new buildings and renovations of apartment buildings. As an example, eight types of multi-family houses with single-family house qualities were examined more closely and measures and criteria for their promotion and construction were presented.

With the current technological status in prefabricated timber construction, the doors to Industry 4.0 in construction are opening. At the same time, Building Information Modeling BIM is becoming more and more popular as a planning method. Digital networking takes place with BIM, the quality of planning should be improved, the construction process should be accelerated and a sustainable life cycle of buildings should be supported. In reality, experience paints a different picture: The pressure to implement BIM is increasing, but the conceptual foundations and agreements that enable the continuous flow of data between planning and execution are missing. Due to an analogue understanding of planning, the potential of digital possibilities and new methods is not fully exploited. Ultimately, a lack of knowledge about the actual information needs of the timber construction company leads to over-informed models and mountains of data garbage with sometimes contradictory information. To develop solutions, the BIMwood project team explored controversial situations, named challenges and opportunities and started an exploratory test plan.

The rise of PV installations on rooftops and residential storage will enable a significant mix of clean energy in the grid. P2P energy platforms are in the research focus on enable small customers to actively participate in energy markets, and become prosumers. Network tariffs are currently only levied on consumers (not producers) of electricity and there is no distinction made based on the centralised or decentralised source of the electricity, regardless of the consumer’s proximity to the source of generation.As a part of the eNet project, together with VGS, HSLU plans to develop and test novel dynamic tariffs that promote trading between neighbours in order to avoid congestion and promote efficient usage of the distribution grid. The first part of the project studies the possible impact of P2P trading on the physical grid in terms of thermal and voltage limits. Then, network tariffs will be verified and tested on the synthetic test system and load profile data. In the end, demonstration is planned on LKW network.In connection with the project, HSLU also leads Subtask 1 of the IEA's Global Observatory for peer to peer and transactive marketplaces, which is concerned with power systems integration. HSLU was also recently successful in securing Innosuisse funding to investigate grid pricing in peer-to-peer markets."," Presciuttini Anna,  Papaemmanouil Antonios,  Giordano Lea,  Dudjak Viktorija,  Sidqi Yousra"," Bowler Benjamin,  Papaemmanouil Antonios"

Human health and planetary health are fundamentally interconnected. All human beings can, and do, affect the health of individuals, communities, ecosystems and the planet as a whole. Herein, climate change is recognized as a serious, worldwide public health concern. It is likely to increase health risks such as heat-related disorders, respiratory disorders and vector borne diseases and to accelerate the ecological and social disintegration connected to it. For individuals, aside from the direct health effects of pollution and changes in biodiversity, climate change and ecological global threats may lead to fear, depression or mental health problems. Global climate initiatives, such as those in Madrid or Paris, continuously fail to provide valuable solutions. In complement, young peoples’ movements, local initiatives and small action groups all over the world create microcosms of communities that produce real changes – even though limited to local coverage only. These initiatives bear a twofold relevance: first, they promote individual and community health and second, they promote societal and cultural change in favor of planetary health. The globally widespread initiatives on environment and climate change are numerous, various, and disconnected. By creating a common space for exchange and visibility, these local initiatives gain visibility and a global network. On an interactive web-portal (www.people-planet-health.com) local projects upload their tags, project stories and project descriptions in order to become visible, to connect with each other and to learn from each other. The website is linked and distributed by the Secretariat of IUHPE (International Union of Health Promotion and Education) that through its global networks guarantees a worldwide distribution. In a second phase, a position paper for the new WHO health promotion strategy will be written in a co-creation process of all initiatives of the project people-planet health."," Mikolasek Michael,  Mérinat Tobias", Meier Magistretti Claudia

The idea of this project is to develop an approach to researching and designing internal communication, in which internal communication is not only oriented towards the strategic goals of company management, but also towards the specific communication behavior of company employees. For this purpose, selected employees of a university institute were each accompanied for one day (so-called shadowing). The communication protocol collected in this way was then analyzed and deepened using a guideline interview. The study revealed interesting results both in relation to internal communication in general and in relation to communication at the specific institute. Among other things, it was shown that all employees spend more time with communicative activities than with individual work, that the architecture has an influence on the communication structures that should not be overestimated, that personal networks are determined by the tasks, that e-mails are the most important means of communication, but also causes stress and idling, and that the official information is received only very selectively. The communication at the analyzed institute turned out to be strongly institutionalized, open, direct and yet characterized by the necessary respect. The communication styles of superiors and employees differed in some cases strikingly. When it comes to sensitive topics, certain people feel that the tone of conversation is not sensitive enough. Open doors and cramped multi-person offices lead to lively exchange, but also prevent concentrated work. The pilot study shows that with the combination of methods used, the communicative processes in a company department can be precisely surveyed and form a suitable basis for discussion for improving internal communication. Disadvantages of the method are a lack of representativeness and a lack of anonymity. It is planned to carry out larger-scale, comparative studies in companies in other sectors."," Parmiggiani Steiner Florence,  Danielli Giovanni,  Wehrmüller Isabelle,  Stettler Jürg,  Boenigk Michael,  Renz-Mehr Rebekka,  Elmiger Süess Rita,  Reichmuth-Deflorin Yvonne", Bendel Larcher Sylvia

The MDR increases the requirements for the technical documentation (TD), which proves compliance with all legal obligations and is an indispensable prerequisite for the market access of the product. As part of the ITC project, it should therefore be examined how the creation and update process of technical documentation can be digitized. This should offer the user a better overview, be less error-prone and eliminate duplication. The results should show how the handling of the complex process can be simplified and how efficiency and transparency can be increased.

To prove the potential and to quantify the increase in efficiency, a prototype of a power-controlled S/W-WP will be implemented and tested. Various control strategies (sole control of the compressor and simultaneous control of the compressor and brine circulating pump) are examined in this system and compared in terms of efficiency with the on/off-controlled S/W-HP. All of the relationships and knowledge gained in this project with regard to the development and control of power-controlled S/W-WP and W/W-WP are described in the design bases in a way that is appropriate to the needs and addressee."," Brun André,  Wellig Beat,  Godarzi Cyrus,  Zajonc Dominic,  Etterlin Matthias,  Kleingries Mirko,  Schärli Peter,  Hoffmann Sebastian,  Flück Stefan,  Käch Tobias,  Birrer Werner"," Gasser Lukas,  Wellig Beat"

The project examines how the relevant (German-Swiss) organizations select, prepare, accompany and train these people. significant number of non-formally qualified people are employed in ECEC in Switzerland. These caregivers are people without formal training, ie without a Federal Certificate of Competence (EFZ) in the field of care and without higher education (e.g. university of applied sciences or higher technical college). You have (e.g. as a pre-intern) no completed preparation in this field of activity or have completed non-officially recognized training (e.g. as a nanny). Organizations in the early years (e.g. day care centers) are often forced to use non-formally qualified staff for cost reasons. Although the financing conditions in the field of ECEC are not comparable with the conditions in the formal education system, the goal must be to shift the ratio of formally qualified and non-qualified staff clearly towards professionalisation. An important step in this direction is to enable more staff without formal qualifications to acquire a formal qualification while working in ECEC. Improving the quality of the selection, preparation, support and training of staff without formal qualifications is an important basis for this step. Given the importance of early childhood, it is important that the quality of ECEC with its three dimensions of structure, process and orientation is as high as possible. It is therefore of central importance that the organizations in the early stage carefully select non-formally trained employees and prepare them appropriately, accompany them and train them further. The aim of the project, in close cooperation with various practice partners and experts, in different fields of action in the field of ECEC in German-speaking Switzerland is to determine to what extent and under what framework conditions non-formally qualified personnel are used, which exceed the quality standards in the field of ECEC selection, preparation, support and training are and to what extent these standards are adhered to in practice. On the basis of this survey, a practical guide is to be developed in a participatory process, which supports the organizations concerned in designing the quality of the selection, preparation, support and further training of these employees as well as possible. The project runs accordingly at the interface of science and practice. Furthermore, by involving decision-makers from politics and administration and by disseminating the project results with lectures and publications, a contribution should be made to improving the framework conditions for ECEC in general."," Meier Magistretti Claudia,  Schraner Marco"," Hafen Martin,  Meier Magistretti Claudia"

In particular, investments abroad have been followed with interest by institutional investors in recent years and will be a focus in the coming years. The growing interest can be attributed to three factors. Firstly, the investment volume, particularly for pension funds, will increase over the next few years. Secondly, institutional investors are finding it increasingly difficult to invest in suitable properties with attractive returns in Switzerland. Third, institutional investors, especially pension funds, have a very low allocation to foreign real estate investments.

The existing hardware infrastructure for working with deep neural networks lacks a software tool chain to efficiently train and adapt models. In the field of natural language processing, some groundbreaking advances have been made in the last 2-3 years. Several new and more powerful machine learning approaches and models have been proposed. During training, these models usually process a very large amount of unstructured text data in order to gain knowledge about the characteristics of a language, its words and its sentences. This training phase is very computationally intensive with modern deep learning models, but only has to be carried out once per language become. For specific applications, such a pre-trained base model can then be fine-tuned on a much smaller corpus in order to gain domain-specific knowledge. This approach, called Transfer Learning, is widely recognized as one of the great methodological achievements that makes deep learning approaches much more accessible for industrial projects. Today most researchers publish the source code of their models as well as pre-trained base models to ensure reproducibility and to facilitate further research. However, most of the current research is done with English text, and thus the shared, pre-trained models are only useful for tasks involving English text. With an efficient toolchain, we can quickly test and apply state-of-the-art NLP models and calculate ready-made German models. Some applications require additional fine-tuning of such a model for domain-specific text such as job ads, resumes, or social services reports. As soon as we have calculated high-quality German base models, we plan to make them available to the public to enable further research."," Denzler Alexander,  Bürli Andrin,  Daly Donnacha,  Stalder Florian,  Salzmann Joel,  Mazzola Luca,  Pouly Marc,  Wullschleger Pascal,  Christen Ramón,  Mazumder Sita", Mérinat Tobias

You are in operation without any use. With an intelligent device installation plug, this should be automatically detected and prevented. In the office area there are many devices that must always be available during office hours and are therefore never switched off, not even at night or on weekends. For various reasons, these devices usually do not fall under the EU Ecodesign Directive, which is why they do not have to have an automatic switch-off or particularly energy-saving standby modes. When they are not in use, these devices are therefore useless and useless energy. Timers or smart plugs are rarely used to switch off the devices overnight and over the weekend. However, this means an additional effort. Many devices cannot simply be disconnected from the network either, since they have to be shut down in a controlled manner. This problem is to be solved with an intelligent device installation plug, which is currently being developed by SCHURTER. Integrated into the devices, this component could automatically detect useless operation and then switch off the devices in a controlled manner when they are not in use. In this way, energy waste can be counteracted without the need for user interaction. The aim of this project is the research and development of methods for the automatic detection and avoidance of useless operations. The particular challenge here is to reliably identify useless operations. On the one hand, the devices must not be switched off if they are still in use, because then the user acceptance of this solution dwindles. On the other hand, as much energy as possible should be saved, i.e. the devices should be switched off and on again as close to the usage phase as possible. There are no solutions available on the market that simply and intelligently solve the problem of useless operation. That is why SCHURTER sees great market potential here."," Calatroni Alberto,  Rumsch Andreas,  Paice Andrew,  Vera Benjamin,  Nieke Clemens,  Bolliger Daniel,  von Arx Dieter,  Birrer Edith,  Li Ehu,  Kniesel Guido,  Kaufmann Lukas,  Vogel Manuel,  Biallas Martin,  Friedli Martin,  Wüthrich Martin,  Eberle Patric,  Huber Mittler Patrick,  Kronenberg Peter,  Winterberger Stefan,  Bosser Thomas,  Dudjak Viktorija", Camenzind Martin

That's not exactly how we use our «avatars». This project is much more about reducing what is known as chronic, neuropathic pain caused by paraplegia. To do this, we develop a digital twin or “avatar” of the patient. The projection of this digital twin is mirrored onto a screen for the patient. In this way, the patient can see himself walking in the mirror. This illusion gives the brain enough time to relearn the paradoxical situation of visual perception and movements that feel numb (since the legs cannot be felt). As a consequence, the deafferentation pain created by this conflicting information subsides. The corresponding device was built by the IMT at the HSLU together with the SPC Nottwil.

In addition, certain providers of workwear extend the life cycle of their items, for example by means of repairs. Nevertheless, every year many tons of resource-intensive material are lost forever in disposal or after short-lived downcycling solutions. The starting position of the workwear business area represents a great potential for achieving the goals of the textile circular economy. Workwear is made from the selection of the material, to the design, through production to delivery (sometimes also care and disposal) from the same manufacturer and sometimes also buyers accompanied.

In contrast to machine tools (e.g. milling machines), articulated-arm robots are designed to be much less rigid, which means they are more flexible. For this reason, articulated-arm robots are clearly inferior to modern machine tools in terms of absolute accuracy. The lack of position and path accuracy of the robots has the following main reasons: The accumulation of manufacturing errors in the mechanical components and the flexibility of the axes under operating load. To avoid these errors, many robots are programmed using the teach-in method. The main influence here is the significantly better repeat accuracy. However, the two parameters mentioned have no influence on the repeatability. As part of this CTI project, a real-time method is to be developed with which a given robot can be measured locally in the processing window with as little effort as possible in order to be able to predict the absolute position error to be expected in this processing window. The aim is to be able to calculate a position correction for every possible robot position/processing window. This means that defined positions in space can be corrected so that the robot actually achieves the required accuracy."," Imoberdorf Alexander,  Di Battista Christian,  Zwickl Diego,  Moya Payà Javier,  Hofstetter Jonas,  Stadelmann Jonas,  Zahn Klaus,  Simmen Marc,  Grossmann Marco,  Schnieper Martin,  Schön Martin,  Getachew Robel,  Ehrler Roman,  Ineichen Stefan,  Prud'homme Thierry", Legrand Ralf

With regard to the mobility-intensive and space-consuming lifestyle, which not only increases spatial growth but also fundamentally changes leisure behavior, cities are increasingly taking precautions to be able to react appropriately to the challenges. The structural development should take place towards the inside and focus on the densification of existing settlement areas. This development is stipulated by the Spatial Planning Act. On the other hand, the federal government has also committed itself to the fight against excessive noise pollution: the environmental law and the noise protection ordinance (LSV) of the federal government stipulate that no residential buildings may be constructed in areas with increased noise pollution. In view of the high settlement pressure, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate traffic, industry and leisure noise from residential uses. Research and studies (e.g. Danielle Vienneau et al, 2017) indicate that attractive public spaces provide favorable conditions for the resident population, which can to some extent compensate for the negative effects of noise pollution at the place of residence. A thesis of the spatial planning working group of the Federal Commission for Noise Abatement states that it is possible to partially or fully compensate for the adverse effects on health and well-being caused by permanently closed apartment windows by resting in a different place and at a different time (EKL Spatial Planning Working Group, 2016). However, the compensation effect has not yet been directly proven. To test this hypothesis, spontaneous short surveys are carried out among the users of six different room types in four Swiss cities - Basel, Lausanne, Lucerne and Zurich. A distinction is made between six room types. In doing so, priority is given to rooms in urban residential areas. Areas with tourist and commercial connotations are excluded."," Näther Caroline,  Amenda Ina,  Hofer Katrin,  Störkle Mario,  Müller Meike", Steiner Thomas

In 1999, the railway reform came into force in Switzerland. The SBB was spun off from the federal administration as a special-law AG. A guiding principle of the reform was the separation of political and entrepreneurial responsibility in the further development of the railway. As a result, the orderer-creator principle was introduced in regional transport and cross-border freight transport was left to free competition. In 2014, the financing of the expansion and operation of the rail infrastructure was reorganized and made financially sustainable. What have the reforms brought to the development of the railways?

In the context of urban planning and district development, long-term concepts are often in the foreground. From the point of view of the public sector, strategic considerations take place, often accompanied by research institutes. The participation of the local residents primarily serves to exchange information, identify needs and raise awareness. In this way, framework conditions and visions are sharpened, and concepts are made more precise. Between planning (abstract, plans, diagrams) and realization (space, material, function), however, no spatial, architectural, sensually perceptible objects depict the formulated intentions. Thus, the dialogue between those involved lacks the medium in which such a process should ultimately find its realization: in space, material, time, use - architecture. ""Guerrilla Urbanism"" closes this gap using the example of public urban space through temporary, compact and, above all, through physical instead of abstract actions. As part of an overall concept, these ""spatial experiments"" have a high degree of reality, respond to acute needs or show the potential of places. They are developed in the overall process and implemented (e.g. constructed) and evaluated on site with all those involved. Compared to previous processes in urban development, the ""guerrilla"" approach appears irregular and alternative. For example, it shortens the time between planning and (in this case ""prototypical"") product, so that a direct dialogue can be initiated on site and formulated by all those involved in a spatially target-oriented manner. In the research project, the approach described is documented throughout the process and evaluated after implementation. The aim is to expand the range of methods of citizen participation, urban development and research with a striking product that can be experienced in concrete terms, which is particularly oriented towards the appropriation of public space and the associated identification.

At the end of the 1990s, there was a great need for action in the Basel-/Bernstrasse district of Lucerne - a real downward spiral was underway. In cooperation between the city of Lucerne and four departments of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, ways were to be found of how this quarter could be given new perspectives, so that a positive development can be initiated both in terms of quality of life and in terms of structural development. The focus of the project was less on the analysis than on the implementation of the ideas. Great importance was attached to the cooperation with the population and all active actors on site. Numerous measures and sub-projects have been developed and implemented. These include, for example, the district coordination for children and young people, which since then has bundled all activities of private, state and church institutions under the title ""BaBeL kids"". The BaBeL project, which has received several prizes and awards, is extremely sustainable. After the end of the 5-year project term, a separate quarter-related structure - the association BaBeL - was founded, which has since supported and further developed the follow-up projects.

In the project, the (inter-)national level of knowledge on early detection measures for child endangerment is reviewed and recommendations are derived. In postulate 12.3206 (""Basics for screening for domestic violence in children by health professionals"") of March 2012, Yvonne Feri requested a report on the possibilities of screening for domestic violence in children and recommendations for their implementation. The background was the assumption that children affected by domestic violence can be identified and supported at an early stage through appropriate screenings as part of the regular medical check-ups. At the time of the postulate, it was assumed that there was no scientific basis for such screenings in children, since the focus had previously been on the parents. An evidence-based instrument was required. Although the precautionary manual and the revised checklist for preventive medical check-ups from the Swiss Society for Paediatrics and the ""Guideline for early detection and procedures in medical practice"" from the Swiss Foundation for Child Protection were already available in 2012, to what extent these were and are used in practice and whether in this regard there was a need for further action, but it was unclear. In its reply, the Federal Council also emphasized that the professional handling of suspected hazardous situations by healthcare professionals is also part of the process (reaction to suspicion, knowledge of relevant child and youth welfare offices). In May 2012, the Federal Council voted in favor of accepting the postulate. The Federal Department of Home Affairs was commissioned to prepare the report, with the Federal Social Insurance Office (BSV) in charge. In June 2016, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, together with the Bern University of Applied Sciences and the Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale Valais-Wallis, were commissioned to carry out the project. The study is intended to provide information on the measures for the early detection of threats to children's welfare in Switzerland and abroad, what reliable scientific findings there are on their effectiveness (including benefit-harm analyses) and what recommendations can be derived from this for Switzerland . The focus is on screening instruments in the health sector that are used with a view to children, but instruments from other relevant areas (e.g. childcare, leisure time) should also be taken into account. It needs to be clarified to what extent these instruments are suitable for the early detection of domestic violence against children."," Jud Andreas,  Portmann Rahel", Krüger Paula

The first task in the project was to expand a test bench for water-water heat exchangers so that storage charging and fresh water stations with greater capacity can be tested and further developed. In particular, the test facility is to be supplemented with an automatic tapping device so that stored tapping profiles can be simulated dynamically and repeatedly. In this way, the operating behavior of the fresh water station could be optimized with the boundary conditions remaining the same. In addition, the test stand is to be equipped with an apparatus for emulating the thermal behavior of the solar storage tank so that the solar charging station can be examined realistically. Based on preliminary standards and other considerations, a test concept for the assessment of the performance and the operational behavior of the fresh water and storage loading station should then be worked out. The development status of both products at the beginning of the project was determined and documented and serves as a reference for further development work. Based on measurement data and observations from the laboratory and from the field measurements, optimization approaches with regard to operational reliability, energy efficiency, compact design, interaction of the components, material costs, etc. are developed and refined in brainstroming workshops with the partners. For the purpose of metrological verification in the laboratory, a functional model that can be easily converted hydraulically is produced. A development is to be equipped with a solar charging station and a fresh water station. This system is equipped with measuring and monitoring equipment and continuously measured. Based on the measurement data, the functionality of the two stations can be shown, but also potential for improvement can be found.

In the project, the effects and interactions of complex overall systems of buildings are considered and the dependencies of the individual parts are assessed, renovation strategies are developed in an interdisciplinary manner and measures to increase the renewal rate of building envelopes are presented using a guideline. It is shown that, in addition to the functional useful life, the identity of the building over a longer usage cycle and the ability to adapt to changing usage profiles are decisive for the lifespan of buildings. In this context, the perspective of institutional investors - including pension funds as well as cities and municipalities - is examined in particular. In construction projects, the focus is usually on the construction of the building and its costs. After moving into the building, the maintenance costs begin. The maintenance costs (operation, repair, renewal) make up a large part of the so-called life cycle costs (LCC). These are estimated at around 80% of the total costs. The consequential costs should therefore be taken into account at an early stage, not only in the planning of new buildings, but also in refurbishment and renewal strategies. A larger investment in the construction phase can lead to lower maintenance and dismantling costs. In the current sustainability debate, considering the life cycle is of great relevance due to a holistic approach. In this context, the following thesis is put forward: The cost of providing building materials is still so high that buildings can only be described as sustainable over a longer usage cycle. Considering the cybernetic mode of action of the complex overall architectural system plays an important role in the sustainability of buildings. In the ideal case, an optimization in the constructive connection of individual components leads to a higher performance and economy of the building."," Bossard Beda,  Geissbühler Dieter,  Settembrini Gianrico,  Hincapié Olaya Ingrid,  Trübestein Michael,  Schluck Thomas,  Menti Urs-Peter"," King Marvin,  Trübestein Michael"

A market segment in which this can be usefully implemented is systems for uninterruptible power supply. In the project, the lead batteries of an emergency power system were replaced by a fuel cell system in combination with supercapacitors. Batteries and accumulators have the disadvantage that they have a comparatively short service life and cannot be disposed of ecologically. Fuel cells promise to be an environmentally friendly and low-maintenance alternative. In a preliminary project, initial experience was gained with a functional model in order to then transfer the concept to larger services. A fuel cell system with a maximum output of 10 kW was integrated into a system for uninterruptible power supply in the telecommunications sector. After a successful laboratory test, the prototype for the emergency power supply of a GSM base station was installed in the field.

Sustainability reporting has been carried out annually since 2012 as part of the annual report of Zug Estates AG. By balancing the energy and water consumption of the entire building stock from 2010, the development of the primary energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions of the real estate portfolio of Zug Estates AG could be shown. The development was evaluated, analyzed and documented for the annual business reports by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. A separate sustainability report has been published annually since 2015. In this context, the development of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions were not only analyzed retrospectively, but also forecast up to 2021. These reports help to meet the demands of shareholders and in particular those of the Swiss Foundation for Sustainable Development (Ethos). By 2050, the population of Switzerland should consume two-thirds less energy than today, and greenhouse gas emissions should even be reduced to a quarter. The information sheet SIA Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040) forms the basis for the implementation of this milestone of the 2000-watt society in the building sector. The SIA energy efficiency path is characterized by an overall energetic view: In addition to the operating energy, its gray energy and location-dependent mobility are also included. The SIA Energy Efficiency Path sets target values for the three building categories residential, office and school, for new buildings as well as for conversions and renovations.

As part of the Innotour project ""Destinations Luzern Land"" (2007 - 2010), the previous tourist structures in the canton of Lucerne were analyzed and adapted. Linked to this was the goal of making better use of the potential of the four rural tourism organizations (Seetal Tourism, Sempachersee Tourism, UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch and Pro Region Willisau Wiggertal) in the future and increasing the competitiveness of the tourist offer, its marketing and the supporting function of tourism promotion to improve the canton of Lucerne. This project was implemented from 2009 to 2013. The evaluation of the implementation revealed, among other things, that strategic product development fell short of expectations. Although improved communication channels are available, few new products have been created. In addition, there is still no clear positioning of the individual regions. Based on the evaluation results, rural tourism in Lucerne is now to be further developed and, in particular, (strategic) product management optimized. This first part of the project is mainly about specifying the current strategy of tourism in rural areas and identifying strategic business areas (SGF) and strategic visitor flows (SBS).

As part of the pilot project, an online listening experiment is being carried out in which subjects rate the groove qualities of 250 audio passages from the R&B, fusion, funk, rock and metal genres. In addition, in preparation for the main project, 50 drum patterns will be transcribed and reconstructed on a sample basis. According to Martin Pfleiderer, groove has a positive effect on listeners' emotions, and groove encourages them to move their bodies (Pfleiderer 2006, 2010). The musical factors that trigger this groove experience are largely unexplained. In his Theory of Participatory Discrepancies (PD theory), Charles Keil hypothesized that microtiming is essential for the development of the groove experience (Keil, 1987, 1995, 2010). Several studies have tested this hypothesis, but found no evidence of an association between microtiming and groove experience (Butterfield, 2010; Madison et al., 2011; Madison and Sioros, 2014) or concluded that microtiming tended to be negative affects the groove experience (Frühauf et al. 2013, Davies et al. 2013). Perfectly quantized music samples received higher groove ratings than microtiming music samples in these studies. The project leader and his team carried out a first externally funded project on the topic of groove in 2012-2014 (""The Relevance of Participatory Discrepancies for the Perception of Groove in Jazz and Funk"", SNF  100012L 137794). Keil's hypothesis was tested as part of this study: The results showed that microtiming has a measurable and significant effect on movement behavior. However, this effect was nominally small and depended on the musical expertise of the listener. The experts moved most weakly to perfectly quantized music examples, but most strongly to music examples with authentic microtiming, but scaled down to 40% of the deviations. Ie the music experts showed the groove effect most in music with ""tight"" but human timing. The non-experts among the subjects showed no significant differences in their reactions. The results of the HSLU study are in contradiction to the results of the earlier studies, they give new impetus to groove research."," Schwarz Jürg,  Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Bechtold Toni Amadeus", Senn Olivier

As part of the project ""Decentralized energy storage in the building & mobility system"" (Grid Living & Mobility), various storage systems, including those used in plug-in hybrids, are to be examined. Renewable energies are very popular in recent times. Wind power and solar energy in particular are growing very strongly. It is interesting for energy suppliers to be able to buffer large power fluctuations both through decentralized ""power plants"" and through consumers. If this were not possible, line networks would have to be oversized so that all possible extreme situations could not lead to the lines being overloaded. This makes no economic sense. Decentralized storage, which can be controlled by the energy supplier, can be used for peak smoothing. Recently, plug-in hybrids as well as purely electric vehicles have been the subject of more and more discussion, be it on the part of energy suppliers or the automotive industry.

We examine the health and well-being of music students and their support in depth. As part of the long-term project to promote the well-being of musicians, the Lucerne School of Music has carried out three pilot studies, partly together with cooperation partners from Great Britain. The aim was to gain insights into the health and well-being of music students and their professional understanding of well-being and success. First, in collaboration with Dr. David Wasley from Cardiff compared music students from different colleges (n=135) with other students (from programs with peak performance aspects) (Sport, n=67) and with more typical university students (n=71). The state of health and the well-being of the students were recorded and individual characteristics of various underlying characteristics such as optimism, psychological personality traits and perception of competence were also taken into account. The well-being, quality of life and self-efficacy of first-year students (first-semester students, N=99) at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts were then recorded. The new students were also asked about their understanding of well-being and success as well as related connections. Finally, the sample was expanded to include music students from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and the University of Leeds, UK (N=213), in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Karen Burland and Dr. Kate Blackstone from Leeds. This data collection was supplemented by individual interviews with four bachelor and four master students in order to examine selected findings from the questionnaire in detail. Freshman music students performed worse than the general population on the domains of well-being and physical and mental health (Studies 1-3) and frequently reported instrumental/vocal-related health problems (68%) (Studies 2-3). This largely corresponds to the results of previous studies from different countries and confirms the acute need for action. On the other hand, music students have a high awareness of the nuanced understanding of wellbeing in relation to their art form and the importance of this; they understand well-being as part of their success as future professionals and recognize the importance of healthy behaviors. Nevertheless, they sometimes find it difficult to implement this knowledge in everyday life; 40% of the new students stated that they would continue to practice regularly despite physical complaints. Key traits that contribute to well-being in music students include perceptions of competence (Study 1) and self-efficacy (Studies 2-3). This, together with the knowledge that music students request health-related support from the music college (Studies 2-3), provides approaches for the development and further development of concrete support measures."," Baldassarre Antonio,  Sigrist Carlo,  Rose Dawn Carole,  Rose Dawn,  Hoesl Florian,  Szamatulski Katrin,  Sandmeier Nicole,  Senn Olivier,  Jerjen Rafael,  Bechtold Toni Amadeus,  Halter Valérie", Alessandri Elena

The project is doing the necessary preparatory work to clarify this question as part of a national fund project. As part of the ""School music discourses in German-speaking Switzerland from 1970 to 2010"" project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), it was possible to work out patterns of interpretation in relation to the function and structure of school music lessons. Central aspects were the indisputable primacy of practice (Huber, 2016), legitimacy via transfer effects (Huber, 2017) and the relationship to possible reference disciplines such as musicology and educational science with corresponding hegemony efforts by the actors involved (Huber, 2016, 2021b, in preparation). ). It was also shown that knowledge is associated with certain forms of linguistic expressions that differ from the scientific style (Huber & Marty, 2021). In a follow-up project, the postulated echo of this interpretation pattern in the teaching practice of grammar schools will be examined. The ""Music lessons at grammar schools"" project is doing the necessary preparatory work to submit a corresponding application to the SNSF by October 1, 2021 and to prepare the start of the project financed by the SNSF. Since patterns of interpretation are collective forms of knowledge with a corresponding tradition, the view is extended to the intergenerational system, which includes lecturers in subject didactics, students of school music, teachers at high schools and high school students. The following steps are necessary on the way to the SNSF application: Development of a theoretical framework for the study; examination of possible variants; Development of the methodical tool; Clarification of cooperation with national and international project partners; Establishment of an advisory group (Sounding Board); Formulation and revision of the scientific part of the SNSF application."," Marty Christoph,  Camp Marc-Antoine", Huber Jürg

As part of a short market research study, the Institute for Financial Services Zug (IFZ) evaluated for the project partner PlaynVoice which automated telephone solutions (voicebots) could be used to support the target group insurance brokers (and industry-related companies). After a few expert discussions, it quickly became clear that the day-to-day work of a broker is usually very individual and customers on the phone need more individual treatment, which is difficult to handle via automated channels. But what is missing are good mechanisms for measuring customer feedback. Since brokers or similar companies still have more telephone contact with their customers, automated feedback emails, which are increasingly used in e-commerce, for example, are not a solution here. In cooperation with individual brokers and the project partner PlaynVoice, the IFZ has analyzed what such an automated telephone solution (voicebot) for measuring customer feedback from brokers should look like. With the help of the IFZ, the project partner PlaynVoice was able to develop a first prototype and even evaluate it in some cases. Further work packages to improve this first so-called NPS voice bot have already been developed. The evaluation focused on the solution with regard to the end user on the one hand, but also on the solution and the web user interface that is to be operated by the brokers. During the evaluation, the IFZ also placed a great deal of focus on the data protection requirements of brokers. It has been shown that the issue of data protection must be given very high priority during implementation. For brokers and other insurance-related companies, it is extremely important that customer data is stored in Switzerland or at least within the EU. At the end of the project, the IFZ and the project partner PlaynVoice are even in contact with Swiss insurance companies, which also want to test the NPS voicebot in the future and possibly want to use it permanently with the help of fuzzy logic, as well as the resulting optimization suggestions for companies, are already being planned. Initial clarifications are currently being made with other possible project partners.

As part of a pilot project, orchestras are being supported in setting up workplace health promotion not only on the basis of isolated activities, but systematically. Particular attention is paid to psychosocial factors such as leadership, communication channels and competitive pressure. Studies have shown that working in an orchestra is associated with physical, mental and psychosocial stress. To date, however, there is no systematic company health management (BGM) for Swiss professional orchestras. The project aimed to reduce the demonstrably unhealthy working conditions in the orchestra and to promote and maintain the health resources of the musicians. A detailed analysis and assessment of the current work situation was carried out on behalf of the Zurich Opera House. Based on this, together with the musicians. Targets and measures derived and implemented. Key people such as the management of the orchestra (on an artistic and administrative level), the professional associations (on the employer and employee side) and specialists from music medicine also participated in the project management. This enabled an optimal deepening and expansion of the cooperation on the topic. The implemented measures will be evaluated in 2014. With this model project, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts launched a health promotion project for a Swiss professional orchestra for the first time in Switzerland."," Stremlow Jürgen,  Näpfli Keller Nadine,  Auerbach Sarah,  Fercher Vanessa", Basler Monica

As part of the Lucerne Festival (LF), the Lucerne Festival Academy Orchestra gave a symphony concert on September 5, 2008 in the concert hall of the Lucerne Culture and Congress Center (KKL) exclusively with compositions from the 20th and 21st centuries. In addition to two world premieres and works by Luciano Berio and Elliott Carter, the program included Igor Stravinsky's ""Le Sacre du printemps"", one of the key works of the 20th century. Pierre Boulez, founder and artistic director of the Festival Academy, conducted the concert. The project ""Phono-Monographie Lucerne Festival Academy 2008"" accompanied and researched this concert event in its various facets from the choice of program through the rehearsal phase to the reception by the audience and the media. The concert program showed Boulez' handwriting by combining classical modern works with those of his generation as well as two world premieres. The compositions by Ondrej Adamek and Johannes Boris Borowski that were premiered could be classified on the one hand as more postmodern (Adamek) or on the other hand as modern aesthetics (Borowski). The examination of the trial phase showed that Boulez's intentions were grasped by the students and mostly implemented. This was reflected, among other things, in an interpretation of ""Le Sacre du printemps"", which, as the corresponding analysis showed, fits logically into the series of Boulez' recordings. The interviews with people from the audience revealed a surprisingly colorful picture of the reception, from which certain structures could be discerned. The results of the research work were reflected in a 180-page publication which, together with the recording of the concert, was published as a ""phono monograph"" (ie as a book with CDs inserted in the cover) as planned by Chronos-Verlag Zurich at the end of the project.

The aim of this project was to gain insights into the demolition dynamics. Within the framework of narrative interviews, ten young people were asked about their experiences in earlier instrumental lessons and the reasons for dropping out. The analysis of the recorded conversations made it possible, on the one hand, to record orientation patterns in the lives of the young people and, on the other hand, to record the teaching concepts of the teachers from their point of view. In many cases, dropping out of lessons can be explained by discrepancies between the ideas of young people and teachers. The young people saw music lessons more as a leisure activity, but experienced it as a performance-oriented subject from the teacher's point of view. The repertoire that was developed often did not correspond to their musical interests, and the group activities (playing together in ensembles and bands) did not take up enough space compared to individual lessons. Finally, some students showed unfavorable family conditions for practicing. The results of the project were summarized in an article that appeared in the ""Schweizer Musikzeitung"" (No. 7/8 2007). As part of a follow-up project, it is planned to process the results in workbooks for the training of music teachers."," Emmenegger Claudia,  Rorato Miriam", Brand Marc

Innovative and sustainable solutions are developed in a participatory process. In the entire rural area of Switzerland, there is an erosion of primary care by general practitioners, including in the canton of Uri. Retiring general practitioners are increasingly unable to recruit successors to their practices. In addition to basic medical care, the affected regions are also confronted with challenges related to the population structure (emigration, demographic aging) and the maintenance or adaptation of the infrastructure to current needs (shops for everyday needs, schools, childcare, social meeting places). In order to be able to cope with the upcoming challenges in the canton of Uri, the district administrator of Uri commissioned the establishment of a ""health network"" in the canton of Uri. In the present project, the question of basic medical care is placed in the context of regional development and the problem is broadly supported, including all important stakeholders, in order to jointly develop long-term, sustainable and locally adapted solutions. The project is based on a socio-spatial approach and an integral approach to the project methodology, which not only focuses on the achievement of goals, but also places value on the process level. Active participation of the addressees, needs orientation, networking and the right to sustainable effects are key terms in this context. In addition to a comprehensive situation and stakeholder analysis, individual and group discussions are held with key persons or groups in order to obtain the different points of view and assessments of the situation.

Among other things, the study came to the following conclusions: Both sales and employment growth are higher for VC-financed companies than for CVC-financed ones. When examining individual transactions, it turns out that CVC as such has no independent influence on sales and employment growth. Furthermore, all interaction variables of CVC are not statistically significant and can therefore be ignored. While VC mostly finances the founding of a start-up company, CVC is used more in later rounds of financing. In three out of four financings, a VC investor invests alone, while corporates seek cooperation with other investors. With regard to real options considerations, it is noticeable that CVC and VC differ only slightly from one another.

Goals – The practical knowledge of older people with leadership, management or consulting experience should be used for charitable causes. – Older people are given the opportunity to shape their post-professional phase of life with like-minded people with a wealth of perspectives. – Support and development of civil society. Implementation and results Innovage is now available in seven regions of Switzerland (Northwestern Switzerland, Bern-Solothurn, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, Zurich, Romandy and Ticino). In these regions, networks have formed in which the Innovage consultants have joined forces. The regional Innovage networks are independent, self-organized associations of consultants who work free of charge for civil society initiatives and develop corresponding offers. These can be consulting tasks as well as the development and realization of your own project ideas. Since the inception of the Innovage project, more than 80 project ideas have been implemented. In the Innovage workshop, participants are supported in their search for suitable tasks and in developing their own project ideas. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts was responsible for the development of the project, for managing the overall project and for developing the framework curriculum for the Innovage workshop. After four years, the regional Innovage networks take over management with a newly founded supporting association innovage.ch. The project continues to be supported by the Migros Culture Percentage with a subsidy and by the Lucerne School of Social Work with specialist advice. Innovage currently has 170 active consultants. In June 2010 the book ""The other career, social commitment in the second half of life - using the example of innovage.ch"" was published. The book deals with the experiences in the Innovage project, contains specialist articles and portrays individual representatives of the Innovage network."," Rindlisbacher Benjamin,  Wandeler Bernard,  Akkaya Gülcan,  Jung Jasmin,  Vögtli Käthi,  Störkle Mario,  Gretler Heusser Simone,  Fercher Vanessa,  Riedweg Werner", Peter Colette

In Europe, 12% to 15% of all couples of reproductive age are affected by infertility, which generates annual costs of around €1 billion. According to experts, this number will double in the next 10 years. In 50% of couples, this infertility is due to the woman's health problems. Almost half of these women have endocrine diseases which, in addition to infertility, have a significant impact on women's health. Such considerations were the inspiration for the quantitative modeling of ""infertility-related endocrinological diseases"" (UEK). The ""PAEON Virtual Hospital"" project consists of 3 pillars. As part of the first pillar (modelling), computer-based models are created for ICEs. Such models depict physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that control and regulate the female menstrual cycle. In addition, the influences of external factors (medication) and environmental influences (e.g. obesity) are shown in the models. The aim of our model is the quantitative assessment of mechanisms leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia and endometriosis. The second pillar of the project (calculations) deals with the development of mathematical tools sufficient to test the effective use of patient-specific models in order to enable subsequent individualized treatment. In the third project pillar (clinical studies), data are collected (e.g. hormone secretion patterns under physiological and pathophysiological conditions) to enable the models and tools from the first two project pillars to be validated and then to provide appropriate feedback. Our consortium consists of highly qualified research institutions (Lucerne University of Applied Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Konrad Zuse Center for Information Technology Berlin) and clinics (Hannover Medical School, Zurich University Hospital)."," Kauss Dominika,  Cometto Edgardo,  Egli Marcel,  Di Nardo Silvio,  Richard Stéphane,  Wernas Timon", Ille Fabian

Among other things, this could increase energy efficiency in households and industry. In industrial, commercial and service companies, electricity data is increasingly being recorded digitally with smart meter devices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the research area concerned with the breakdown (disaggregation) of data from individual consumers. This is achieved using machine learning methods. So far, mainly «supervised learning» has been used - i.e. machine learning approaches that learn on the basis of examples. However, this requires costly, simultaneous measurement of a very large number of power consumers. In order to avoid this disadvantage, we are investigating in the project how «semi-/unsupervised learning» approaches - can achieve comparable results - these require little or no measurement data from electrical consumption. This is intended to promote the use of NILM in the everyday life of companies and private individuals. If it is possible to break down from the NILM recordings how much energy individual electricity consumers consume, various new applications and optimizations can be implemented. Examples of this include increasing energy efficiency in households and in industry, predictive maintenance, needs-based cleaning cycles and applications in the care sector (activities of daily living)."," Bürli Andrin,  Pfäffli Daniel,  Daly Donnacha,  Wullschleger Pascal", Lionetti Simone

With more than 40,000 visitors, the musical was already a success when it was performed in 2015 at Lake Walen. The grandstand for the musical in Melide will be of a similar size. The following questions are of particular interest for the empirical investigation of the effects: To what extent do tourism service providers in particular and the regional economy in general benefit from the performance of the musical? What economic effects are triggered by the musical in the region and in the canton of Ticino? What social effects are triggered by the musical in terms of satisfaction and image? How is the media effect of the musical to be evaluated in different media types? A comparable study was carried out in 2005 for the Heidi Musical in Lake Walen.

The basic report is specified by experts from practice with regard to implementation. A selected program is then evaluated in detail so that – in the event of positive evaluation results – it can be proposed as an example of good practice for multiplication. Results on the effectiveness of universal debt prevention, how children and young people deal with money and the effects of prevention in this area can be expected from the planned literature study. The study will conclude with conclusions for prevention work, which will be worked out in a manual together with practitioners of debt prevention. Initial situation The Aargau-Solothurn debt advice service operates one of the few debt prevention agencies in Switzerland. Although the office has many years of practical experience, the experts have found that there is a lack of opportunities in this area to scientifically justify and support preventive work. In fact, there is little processed knowledge on effective programs in debt prevention, as well as on the factors that encourage young people and young adults to use money in a low-risk manner. Although the extent of the problem of youth debt is clearly shown by current studies, statements on effective debt prevention are limited to assessments and expert surveys.

In Olten, the method kit for district development was used in the context of upgrading the inner city. What was developed for residential areas with special challenges also works for location development in small-town centres. Center development is not just a marketing problem. Rather, it is about a joint development of the structural infrastructure, the economic framework and the ""soft"" aspects that make up a city center. The ""soft"" aspects include social needs, identity (which is expressed, for example, in the ""image"") and the function of public spaces as meeting places, but also as places for negotiation. A lively center needs a balance between economic offers, residential uses and cultural stimulation. The inner city district development takes on the role of a ""hinge"" between the city administration and the actors in the inner city. It also networks and supports initiatives in the city centre. Their function is mediation, communication, coordination and practical support. It enables the participation of the population and uses their resources (associations, culture, voluntary work, churches, etc.) for the process. The district developer does not act as a consultant and expert, but as an intermediary. Experience shows that it is advantageous to come from outside and not to be ""part of the system"". For the 30% mandate, an external expert, Tom Steiner, was hired for two years (2012-2013) as part of the ""downtown strategy"" adopted by the city council. Due to the mandate form, the district development was close to the city administration, but was perceived by the population as independent. District development is a communication task. The objectives of strengthening the city center of Olten as a shopping and cultural location and to ensure the quality of life for the population were communicated with the generally recognized central idea of ""revival"". Core elements of the district development in the city center were: Networking Participation events (""Inner City Meeting"") Ideas competition with ""Marketplace of Ideas"" Support in the implementation of ideas Seats in administrative committees Communication (media work, internet presence, information) Support for the renovation of Kirchgasse Opening festival of Kirchgasse Use of other events such as ""city reading"" as platforms The establishment of a more constructive communication between the administration and the actors in the district as well as the successful implementation of the participatory events and forums are particularly noteworthy as successes in the development of the inner city.

Energy systems are always a socio-economic system. What makes such projects successful? How do you know a project is on track? In Phase I of the SCCER FEEB&D, among other things, the energy concept for the village of Uettlingen in Wohlen near Bern was drawn up. A method for planning energy concepts developed here at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts made a significant contribution to the successful completion of the course. This methodical processing, which is strongly based on systemic thinking, has already been applied to two other projects and further projects are in prospect. Although the Uettligen project was completed successfully and to the satisfaction of everyone involved, it turned out what project managers in the energy industry also experience: the success or failure of projects has a lot to do with the dynamics of the project participants and interest groups as well as the external circumstances. Classic management approaches address this with the well-known approaches to stakeholder analysis and appropriate management. More complex research approaches attempt to reproduce and ultimately understand the dynamics of stakeholder structures. Social modeling and (computer) simulations are often used for this purpose. While such novel approaches are purposefully researched in other areas, this is at best a marginal issue in the field of energy supply. When the CTI (today Innosuisse) initiated new work packages in the SCCER FEEB&D, which were to deal with fundamental and new topics, a sub-package was submitted due to the circumstances described above, which should address the following questions: How can the approaches of stakeholder analysis be profitable in integrate the body of methods developed at the university? How can dynamics be derived from these stakeholder analyzes specifically for the area of energy supply concepts? Are there indicators that show that a project is more likely to succeed or fail? Which indicators are these? Can project dynamics and positioning in the environment be influenced early and advantageously? In conclusion, the question is how to make energy conversion projects more successful. Since the answer to this question reduces the use of resources in projects and accelerates the Swiss energy transition through more successfully implemented projects, the importance of this question for us is undisputed.",, Schluck Thomas

The image of Switzerland – the images of Switzerland – is constantly up for discussion. The research project “Image symbols of Switzerland” focuses on the small but incredibly diverse area of travel souvenirs. In souvenirs, according to the initial thesis of the project, images of Switzerland are presented in a highly concentrated manner. And: Pictures of Switzerland that have been preserved in souvenirs have had a significant impact on the view of our country. Two sub-projects examine a) the historical development of souvenir design and the souvenir industry and b) the experimental design of new images of Switzerland. Sub-project a) The analysis of source material - Swiss travel souvenirs from the last 200 years, historical travel reports and travel guides, literature on design competitions and exhibitions - provides information about the type of geographical reference, about symbolic content, creative and production-related implementation styles and indirectly also about the sender and target audience . Particular attention is paid to interventions by the federal government and tourism associations and the question of how state and para-state actors try to correct images of Switzerland formed in the commercial souvenir industry. The result of this work step are typologies and analyzes of images, motifs and clichés as well as hypotheses on creative innovation strategies. Sub-project b) Parallel to the product analysis, invited designers and artists develop innovative images of Switzerland using experimental methods. Initially, the focus is not on the production of souvenir products that can be produced in series. Rather, the aim is to explore the scope and strategies of innovation in this genre, which is characterized by clichés. On the one hand, the multi-track, cultural-historical and creative approach opens up a deeper understanding of the formation and renewal of images of Switzerland, which can also offer orientation in other areas (e.g. in questions of communication and nation branding); on the other hand, the experimental pictorial designs serve as precedents to illustrate new approaches that future (commercial) design projects can use as an example."," Kennel Cyril,  Steffen Dagmar Johanna,  Kluser Vera"," Nyffenegger Franziska,  Steffen Dagmar Johanna"

For this reason, data on the training of teachers, the implementation of the lessons and the infrastructure were collected and evaluated by means of a nationwide survey. In May 2013, in cooperation with the Association of Swiss School Music (VSSM) and the Swiss Music Council (SMR), the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts collected concentrated data from school administrations on the three subject areas of teacher training, teaching and infrastructure. The non-representative survey was carried out with the support of the relevant professional associations in all parts of the country. According to the information provided by the participating school administrators, the majority of compulsory music lessons take place, with the compulsory offer often ending as early as the 8th school year. At 80% of the responding primary schools, there is a “musical elementary school” or “music and movement” option, which is usually integrated into the timetable. While lessons at primary level usually take place in the classroom, music rooms set up specifically for this purpose can usually be used at secondary level. Due to the reorganization of teacher training at most teacher training colleges, music is no longer a compulsory part of the training. This is probably why teachers without any musical training teach the subject at two-fifths of the responding primary schools. At secondary schools, this affects only one in seven. Here, teachers with a combination of subjects including music teach the subject. Challenges in teacher education are offset by encouraging grassroots activity, according to survey comments. In particular, this concerns the cooperation between the elementary school and the music school, which is expressed, for example, in projects on making music in the classroom."," Alessandri Elena,  Evéquoz Francine,  Zöhner Malgorzata,  Camp Marc-Antoine,  Christof Peter", Huber Jürg

A significant extension of this approach is the use of stereo vision, which would allow a quasi 3D recognition of the scene. Various approaches to this from ""portable"" systems already exist in the literature, but are completely unusable in practice for portable systems due to the rigid spatial arrangement of the two lenses at a distance of typically 10 - 15 cm. In the present project, therefore, alternative ways are to be taken to make stereo vision for indoor navigation systems practical: On the one hand, due to the progressive miniaturization of the camera systems (as used in smartphones), a stereo vision system can also be manufactured more compactly and the first 3D smartphones with dual lenses are already on the market Market. On the other hand, if there is no rigid spatial arrangement of the lenses, a hardware setup consisting of two independent mini-cameras is possible, with both devices being worn loosely attached to the upper body. However, the challenge then lies in the necessarily automated calibration of the two cameras, which is in principle possible by using the IMU data. In the StereoNavigator project, the possibilities and limits of these approaches are to be evaluated in the form of a function demonstrator."," Rosell Ortega Juan Alfonso,  Rumi Nino,  Bruderer Roger", Zahn Klaus

According to investigations by the Federal Competition Commission (WEKO), eight road and civil engineering companies participated in illegal price and contract agreements in the Schwyz districts of March and Höfe between 2002 and mid-2009. In order to identify signs of such price agreements in the years 2009 to 2018, the cantonal civil engineering office in Schwyz commissioned the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to carry out the statistical evaluation (screening) of the bid procedures for the years 2009 to 2018. The method used provides indications of anomalies that point to possible cartels. In a first step, conspicuous awards are identified based on statistical parameters. For example, an award is conspicuous if there is a large difference between the lowest and second-lowest bid, while the other prices are close together. This difference ensures that the designated winner also receives the bid, because other criteria such as technical aspects or references can also influence the award of the contract. In a second step, the behavior of the companies in a year-on-year comparison, according to award procedures and regions, is examined in depth.

There are first indications that this led to opposing developments over time: on the one hand, an increase in the attractiveness of everyday trips in the local area and increased use of public transport, but on the other hand, an increase in the distances traveled for certain transport purposes (e.g. longer commutes). to work and longer distances on holiday trips with an increase in flights).

The development of these instruments takes place in close cooperation with three practical partners in the disabled sector. In the past ten years, inpatient assistance for the disabled in Switzerland has changed significantly in political and practical terms. New scientific findings and guiding ideas, but also international concepts and framework conditions have made a significant contribution to this paradigm shift. As part of these developments, the individual needs of people with disabilities and the related outpatient measures have come more into focus. This person-centred focus was taken up in the context of several CTI research projects (2005-2011) carried out at the University of Zurich (department of special education) on the quality of life of people with disabilities. In these projects, instruments were developed to record the quality of life of people with disabilities in the area of housing. In this project, the focus should be on the work area of people with disabilities. The aim of the project is the conception of three differentiated questionnaires to record the quality of life in the areas of work and vocational training. The instruments are intended to provide those responsible in workshops for people with disabilities with a reliable basis for recording job satisfaction and the opportunity for further recommendations for person-centred development of people with disabilities."," Schwarz Jürg,  Keller Sarah,  Rabhi-Sidler Sarah,  Aeschbach Susanne", Stalder René

In the past ten years, China has developed into one of the most important foreign markets for the tourism region of Lucerne – Lake Lucerne. In recent years, the proportion of individual travelers from China has increased continuously. The emergence of new forms of travel often brings with it a change in travel behavior and new needs of the guests. Therefore, three destinations and various service providers have joined forces under the leadership of Luzern Tourismus AG and with scientific support from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in order to gain a better understanding of the needs and behavior of Chinese individual travelers. Appropriate offers for this specific target group were developed and marketed based on the acquired knowledge base. This with the intention of actively directing the flow of visitors in the Lucerne – Lake Lucerne region. Among other things, the following insights into the Chinese individual travel market resulted from the project. Framework conditions: The framework conditions have a strong influence on travel demand from China. Strong economic growth and the associated greater purchasing power of the middle class have led to a strong increase in demand. However, state interventions and regulations (including visa regulations, luxury tax, corruption laws) also lead to a collapse in demand or to a change in travel behavior. Travel Behavior: Chinese individual travelers, like group travelers, are interested in the main attractions. However, it has been shown that individual travelers have more diverse interests, are more flexible in terms of time, stay longer in one place or in a region and consequently also explore attractions off the most popular tourist paths. Individual travelers describe their trip to Switzerland as a nature trip. Switzerland is considered a relaxing contrast to metropolises such as Milan or Paris. Information and booking behavior: Chinese individual travelers are characterized by a high need for information. They prepare meticulously for the trip and use the support functions of booking platforms to do so. They want to be flexible on site. Therefore, offers are only booked in advance if they offer a special experience value or contribute to risk reduction. Bundled products are rarely booked due to the lack of price transparency. Spending behavior: Chinese individual travelers spend a lot of money on their trip. On average it is 310 CHF per day per person for travel-related services. That's slightly more than group travel. And the shopping expenses also show that, like group travellers, they like to shop a lot. It can also be assumed that the added value is more widely distributed among individual travelers and that more companies will therefore benefit from the travel expenditures made."," Egli Alain,  Denzler Alexander,  Steffen Angela,  Geyer Carolin,  Eggli Florian,  Frölicher Jonas,  Huck Lukas,  Keller Lukas,  Kaufmann Michael,  Müller Sabine", Stettler Jürg

In the discussion about the future development of the Rigi, various interest groups came together at a ""Round Table on Sustainability on the Rigi"" and developed a joint ""Charta Rigi 2030"" in several workshops. This is now to be implemented in a process supported by the New Regional Policy. Two concrete steps are planned for this: Firstly, the preparation of a development plan that systematically plans, prioritizes and controls the projects and development measures. Goals, indicators and a monitoring concept are developed, a portfolio of projects and measures is created and a business model for a future supporting organization is developed. Second, the Rigi Conference is a participatory format that involves the general public. The Rigi Conference provides information on the ongoing implementation of the ""Charta Rigi 2030"" and invites the population to help shape the process with their own inputs and ideas. While a first conference in March 2021 is part of this project, such a conference is to be held regularly in the future.

The village shop in the municipality of Silenen was endangered, in Realp the shop was closed years ago. However, the village shop is of great importance - especially for small communities: for local supply and as an infrastructure for tourism, but also for village life and the identification of the population with the village. The project was about the village shop itself as well as living together in the village. Therefore, new business models were needed that provide a wide variety of services for locals and tourists, honor important functions of the shop for village life (e.g. as a meeting place and place for networking), but also use the resources of the community (e.g. volunteering at special events) . In the two communities in Central Switzerland, locally adapted concepts were developed with the involvement of the population as to how various functions and services can be bundled in the ""village service center"". Particular attention was paid to demographic change, the various aspects of integrating the population who have moved here, and the promotion of sustainable tourism. Since the sustainability of such service centers depends on many different factors, an integral, interdisciplinary and participatory approach was important.

Individual interviews were held with nine young people who are completing language training at Caritas Lucerne. Music plays a key role in young people's identity formation. The experience of identity describes both a social process and a form of interaction. Young people in particular often use music (as a performative complex that includes movement and dance, making and listening to music) to express their belonging and differentiation from other individuals and groups. Music is an important part of their personality, which constantly changes and strengthens during these years of life. The selection of the respective music, the musical taste, is based on cultural codes and musical symbols that express a certain group affiliation and that correspond best to one's own self-image and lifestyle. Young people's choice of music is also shaped by their need to belong to a certain group and the associated sense of community. Music unites perception, movement and communication. It proves to be the ideal medium for addressing young people, “pulling them out” and creating contact. Since musical action is neither neutral nor objective, but rather an expression of a (often cultural) group affiliation, it has important socio-cultural functions. In addition, the medium of music conveys feelings. The realization that music triggers certain emotions in others as well as in ourselves is a crucial step towards better interpersonal understanding. The aim of this project was to investigate how unaccompanied, asylum-seeking young people identify themselves musically, how they differ from their new surroundings or how they adapt. The focus was on young people aged 16 to 21 (refugees, temporarily admitted persons, asylum seekers) in the “School & Job Training” program run by Caritas Luzern. The interviews revealed that the mobile phone is not only their most important all-purpose device, it was also used to collect data to supplement the young people's limited German language skills. The music they listen to on their mobile phones is important for those surveyed in order to maintain contact with their homeland (family, language) and to regulate their feelings. The two main categories are ""happy"" and ""sad"" music. Interestingly, the taciturn and quiet in the German class also got involved as soon as they were asked about their music. They felt competent to talk about their own music. Such conversations increase their self-esteem and self-confidence. Since the subject of music appeals to emotions, it is particularly well suited for language development. A guide to the use of music and musical knowledge by adolescents would therefore be desirable for institutions where young asylum seekers are taught.", Camp Marc-Antoine, Simonett Helena

The project uses a qualitative case study analysis to examine the practice in six selected Swiss cantons. The code of conduct is a common compliance tool in the private sector. Organizations use it to define universal basic rules for correct and honest action and to establish their corporate values. The Code of Conduct is intended to ensure compliance with laws and guidelines and ultimately contribute to the good reputation of the company. Various studies underline the spread and importance of this instrument in Switzerland, both for large corporations (e.g. Ethos 2013; KPMG & RSM 2015) and for SMEs (e.g. Wind 2018: 118). For decades, the code of conduct has also been the subject of business research (examples: Brand & Winistörfer 2016; Collins 2019; Doig & Wilson 1998; Kaptein & Schwartz 2008; Makowicz 2018; Statler & Oliver 2016; Werner & Webley 2008; Wind 2018). Reputational risks also play an important role in public administration and compliance is a key issue. However, there are diverging approaches in terms of the concepts used, particularly in the cantonal administrative practice in Switzerland. This also applies in particular to the code of conduct instrument: individual cantons make conscious use of this; in others it is not present. In the scientific literature there are publications that shed light on the topic of codes of conduct in an administrative context (e.g. Abdelmotaleb & Saha 2018; Bischoff 2003; Faust 2014; Garcia-Sanchez, Rodriguez-Dominguez & Gallego-Alvarez 2011; FHöV NRW 2011; Gilman 2005; Löffler 2000; Macaulay 2018; Malkmus 2011; Prorok 2007; Rothstein & Sorak 2017). However, little research has been done on the field specifically for Switzerland and the canton level (but cf. Hofmeister 2000; Huber-Hotz 2016; Schindler 2003; also Häner 2014). Based on these observations, the project examines the cantonal infrastructure in the field of rules of conduct and in particular the use of codes of conduct using a qualitative case study analysis for six selected Swiss German cantons. At the time of the study, three cantons in the sample had a cantonal code of conduct and three did not. On the basis of a comparison of the existing codes of conduct in all the cantons examined, the reasons for creating a code and the reasons for not using this instrument as well as the desired functions and benefits are examined in more detail. In addition, an in-depth comparative examination of formalities, content, history of origin, usage practice and procedural design of the three cantonal codes of conduct is carried out within the study. Concrete recommendations for action are derived from the findings of the case studies and their analysis in the light of administrative and business literature and practice, which are intended to support administrations in the creation and use of codes of conduct."," Gantenbein Adrian,  Hübscher Bettina", Oehri Isabelle

In Switzerland, every fourth apartment (ie 890,000 apartments) is in an apartment building from the 1940s to 1970s. Although the majority of them are not (yet) under protection, they are gaining increasing interest in monument preservation. The clash of public interests after reducing energy consumption and maintaining building culture often leads to the undesirable result that these residential buildings and settlements are renovated with a long delay or not at all. In cooperation with experts from the fields of energy, building culture, urban development and implementation in the cities of Basel, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zug, strategies for holistic renovation were developed for 13 protected residential buildings and settlements. It was shown that the heating energy requirements of residential buildings and settlements from the 1940s to 1970s can be reduced by around 50% on average without losing the Baukultur value.

Promotion of inter-institutional exchange and nationally representative data By networking the important players in child protection, work is being done to establish uniform and reliable data on the care situation in the event of a threat to the welfare of children throughout Switzerland. In Switzerland, many different institutions offer help and protection for neglected, abused and sexually abused children and young people - child and adult protection authorities, victim support centres, child and youth welfare facilities, police units, private advice centres, children's hospitals and much more. Although the various institutions often work together intensively in individual cases, e.g. in the context of reporting dangers to the authorities, the technical exchange between different institutions on common concerns outside of the individual case is still rather limited nationwide. Even if the various institutions collect their own data on cases of child endangerment in their care, there is a lack of nationally representative data across various institutions and areas that allow a comparison of the number and type of cases. This can lead to gaps in care or regional differences in the number and type of pending cases not being recognized and accordingly not being addressed. In a joint national project, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and the University of Lausanne have set themselves the goal of tackling these gaps in knowledge about appropriate care for those affected. To this end, the professional exchange of the various institutions in civil and criminal law child protection, in the social and health care sector should be strengthened. Previous knowledge about the frequency of cared for and examined cases of abuse and neglect should be collected and suggestions for a practical collection of data should be accepted. The initiative is part of the Optimus Study Switzerland. Through this networking phase, we are striving for a practicable national data collection on all forms of abuse in 2015, with as high an institutional participation as possible and an increase compared to 2010.", Stutz Mirjam, Mitrovic Tanja

In Switzerland, around two thirds of the population feel disturbed by noise. It is therefore important that noise is taken into account in room planning and rooms are created that have good sound quality. When it comes to measures against noise, the acoustics offices in Switzerland focus mainly on the sound level as the decisive assessment criterion. The acoustic quality, which is just as important for well-being as the visual impressions, has so far been neglected. The Soundscape approach opens up new holistic perspectives by considering the acoustic environment as a resource and focusing on sounds that people prefer. However, there is currently a lack of practical tools to incorporate the idea of soundscapes into environmental acoustics. Together with the practice partner SINUS AG, the potential of generated AR soundscapes and the associated technical requirements for the development and use of such a tool were clarified in this preliminary project. This preliminary project (funded by Innosuisse) was linked to the ITC project ""Generated AR Soundscapes"". The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts provided the following services: Generation of soundscapes: For this purpose, a baseline prototype for generating realistic ambient noises based on 2D images was developed and tested. The prototype has been published on GitHub with more detailed information on how it works: https://github .com/hslu-abiz/soundscape-generation Audio Augmented Reality: For this purpose, a first prototype was developed and tested, which enables spatial audio with a situational and interactive augmented reality application for spatial planning. In a first step, the preliminary study has shown the potential for urban planning processes: 1) the simulation of soundscapes, which can only reproduce the actual acoustic qualities of the urban space with the help of an image as input, are immensely time-saving. 2) Experiencing soundscape directly on site using Audio Augmented Reality enables a new perspective and basis for discussion for environmental acoustics. Based on the collected findings, the joint submission of an Innosuisse project as a follow-up project is being examined together with SINUS AG and other project partners."," Schnellmann Christian,  Pfäffli Daniel,  Wey Yannick", Matter Tobias

On the other hand, digital booking is the norm from the customer's point of view. 67% of customers usually use the internet as a booking channel (Allianz Global Assistance, 2016). For tourism providers with a low degree of digitization, there is therefore an urgent need for action to guarantee long-term and sustainable value creation. This consists of customer integration for the development of digital offers, the use of customer and interaction data to improve marketing and communication measures, and the cross-departmental and cross-functional planning of digital projects (Berghaus, Back, & Kaltenrieder, 2017). Many small companies cannot carry out these steps cost-effectively without external help from digitization and industry experts.

In Switzerland, the cases of Legionnaires' disease are increasing. Last year, the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG) registered more than twice as many cases of severe pneumonia as in 2013. The disease is triggered by inhaling small water droplets containing Legionella bacteria, such as those produced when taking a shower. In around five to ten percent of all cases, the disease is fatal despite antibiotic treatment. The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (BLV), which is responsible for drinking water as a foodstuff, therefore set a maximum limit for legionella in shower and bath water in public buildings in 2017. In addition, the research project ""Legionella control in buildings"" (LeCo, ""Legionella control in buildings"") was launched, in which the Federal Offices of Public Health (FOPH) and Energy (SFOE) are also involved. In the project, which started in 2020, Franziska Rölli from the ""Health and Hygiene"" group at the Institute for Building Technology and Energy IGE at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts will spend the next four years researching how the danger posed by these bacteria in buildings can be contained. The project is managed by a multidisciplinary consortium that will examine the complex topic from a microbiological, medical and technical perspective: - Franziska Rölli (building technology and energy, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts), - Frederik Hammes (drinking water microbiology, Eawag), - Tim Julian (pathogens and Human Health, Eawag), - Daniel Mausezahl (Household and Health Systems, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute), and - Hans Peter Füchslin (Legionella Unit, Cantonal Laboratory Zurich). Among other things, the consortium wants to clarify how the risk of Legionella infection can be assessed when showering. In addition, the aim is to improve the sampling strategy and to optimize the use of rapid detection methods for the reliable detection of contamination in buildings. Furthermore, the connections between sources of infection in the environment and cases of illness are to be recorded and new findings on the ecology of legionella in drinking water systems are to be gained. In addition, the focus is on the development of management strategies to reduce the risk of legionella contamination in buildings, as well as raising awareness and increased exchange between the various stakeholders involved. Last but not least, national and international cooperation in this area should be strengthened."," Sicre Benoit,  Kannewischer Constantin,  Morgenthaler Dave,  Gubser Frank,  Settembrini Gianrico,  Wadsworth Jennifer Louise,  Marek Reto,  von Euw Reto", Rölli Franziska

Seiterle, 2014). While there were only isolated projects in the 1980s, the SSA was first established in larger cities from the 1990s, but later also in agglomerations and rural communities (cf. Baier 2008; Pfiffner, Hofer & Iseli, 2012; Seiterle 2014). Social work has been introduced in the cantons since the 2000s, is represented almost everywhere and has made a lasting impression. The school social workers have formed an association to promote and develop the field of action (cf. SSAV 2013). Current figures show that almost 900 social work professionals work in the German-speaking regions of Switzerland in primary, secondary and vocational schools. At school, different profession-specific justification patterns and expectations from the areas of education and social affairs come together. The present study, which was carried out in cooperation with the Lucerne University of Education, dealt with the question of whether the expectations of the various actors (teachers, school social workers, school principals) converge or diverge. This is an important question because the cooperation of the different actors is demonstrably a central success factor of school social work and it can be assumed that the quality of the cooperation depends on a certain convergence of mutual expectations. The project examined the following questions: 1. What are the similarities and differences among teachers, school leaders and school social workers with regard to the expectations of the services to be provided by the SSA? 2. What are the similarities and differences among teachers, school leaders and school social workers with regard to the expected effect of the SSA? 3. Do any differences vary depending on the framework conditions of school social work? Headmasters, teachers and school social workers from over 60 schools in 11 cantons in German-speaking Switzerland were questioned using questionnaires and differences and similarities were made visible."," Stadelmann Karin Andrea,  Ziegele Uri", Gschwind Kurt

In the in-depth study, the feasibility of technical recommendations for construction in noise-polluted areas that meet the legal and normative conditions was examined. Combinations of automatic, external sun protection, automatic window opening (especially in children's rooms, where this cooling is only possible after midnight), ventilation with a bypass function and efficient cooling were examined. Despite the low cooling capacity, active cooling cannot be completely dispensed with under the given framework conditions (windows not open between 6 a.m. and midnight), since the heat cannot be generated completely by cooling off at night. Optimal solutions are free-cooling via the floor heating and heat pump, in exceptional cases split devices would have to be used if the conditions according to SIA 382/1 are to be met."," Stettler Christoph,  Vetterli Nadège,  Menti Urs-Peter", Brücker Stefan

The results contribute to improving the sports statistical data and information base for sports policy and the various stakeholders. In this study, the economic importance of sports facilities in Switzerland is calculated for the first time. The results contribute to the improvement of the sports statistical database for sports policy and the various actors in the individual sports areas. In Switzerland there are 1,250,000 hectares of exercise areas. Recreational areas close to the city (e.g. part of the traffic area), local recreation areas, recreational areas for excursions and touristic recreation areas are considered movement areas. While there is sufficient exercise space in rural areas, there is sometimes a great shortage of exercise space in the local recreation area, especially in larger cities. In addition to exercise areas, there are around 28,800 permanently installed sports facilities in Switzerland with a new construction value of around CHF 57 billion and 78,000 km of sports trails (hiking, horseback riding and cycling trails as well as cross-country ski trails). The approximately 28,800 sports facilities in Switzerland generated an estimated total operating turnover of CHF 3.1 billion in 2005 and thus generated gross value added of CHF 2.1 billion. This provided a total of 20,700 full-time equivalent jobs (FTE). Sports facilities thus contribute a total of 0.5% to gross domestic product (GDP) and around 0.6% to total employment in Switzerland. Sports facilities account for 23% of the total gross value added generated by sports in Switzerland of around CHF 8 billion. Around 23% of the total of 80,300 employees (FTE) in the sports industry are to be found in the sports facilities. The economically most important of the 14 sports facility categories are the fitness and martial arts as well as the snow and mountain sports facilities. Together, these two categories generate over a third or CHF 345 million each (17%) of the total gross value added. This corresponds to an employment of 4'100 FTE (20%) by the fitness and martial arts facilities resp. of 3,950 (19%) through the snow and mountain sports facilities. Compared to the total stock of sports facilities, the fitness and martial arts facilities (7% of all sports facilities, 17% of the gross value added), snow and mountain sports facilities (6% compared to 17%) and tennis facilities (4% compared to 13%) gain in economic terms. in importance. In contrast, the equestrian sports facilities (24% of all sports facilities, 6% of the gross value added), the sports facilities (19% compared to 8%) and the shooting ranges (8% compared to 1%) are of significantly less importance from an economic perspective than from the perspective of the existing facilities.

The aim of the project is to develop solutions to this problem using WHM measures. At a glance Working in social services places high demands on managers and their employees in many respects. Various empirical studies and the exchange with practice show that many social services have high fluctuation rates and also report difficulties in filling vacancies. There are already current research results on the specific work-related stresses and resources of social workers in social services (cf. Näpfli Keller et al. 2018; Pfiffner 2016). However, hardly anything is known in Switzerland with regard to the focus of possible measures for company health management (WHM), the implementation practice and the need for action in the area of WHM in small and medium-sized social services. The research project aims to clarify these questions on the basis of empirical data and, based on this, to derive recommendations for the planning and implementation of WHM measures that are tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized social services. The multi-stage WHM effectiveness model from Health Promotion Switzerland serves as a theoretical basis, which shows that appropriate WHM measures can have a positive influence on fluctuation and the image of organisations. The methodological approach includes (a) an online survey of managers from small and medium-sized social services, (b) focus groups with managers from social services to validate the findings from the survey and the development of WHM measures, and (c) guided interviews with managers and HR Managers of large social services as a basis for the development of good practice recommendations.

This became clear at the latest with the introduction of the housing evaluation system WBS (Federal Office for Housing 2021), which measures the quality of residential buildings for their users. The net living area is one factor to consider, but not the only one. New living terms such as ""microliving"" and ""tiny housing"" have become popular in recent years. The interdisciplinary project examines the potential of small living arrangements*, in particular considering user needs, different architectural typologies and a focus on social science, architectural spatial, building law, economic and ecological factors. The results are made applicable in socio-demographic profiles of the demand and user segments and as practice-oriented recommendations for planning and action. * So far, there is no generally recognized definition of small living arrangements. In the context of this study, this includes architectural typologies in single-family houses (EFH) such as tiny houses, mini-houses, different types of mobile homes such as caravans or houseboats, but also typologies in multi-family houses (MFH) such as micro apartments or collective housing forms such as shared apartments or cluster apartments.", Perpignano Ersilia Adele, Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne

The latter is becoming increasingly important: on the one hand, because developments can be delayed or even prevented by resistance from the population, which entails risks and thus conflicts with the interests of the city or municipality and possible property developers. On the other hand, the needs of the civilian population are also given more weight: Socio-spatial aspects are included in the area and area development by the cities and municipalities in order to take the needs of the different population groups into account and incorporate them into further planning. Visualizations for the communication of content play an important role in site development. In participatory processes in particular, conveying content in a way that is appropriate to the addressee plays a key role in the success of a project, which is why process-related communication is of great importance - not only in relation to the mediation formats themselves, but above all to the dramaturgy, the targeted use of the available ones Mediation formats depending on the respective process phase and on the prerequisites that can be assumed in relation to the understanding of visualizations and other mediation formats by laypeople. The aim is to develop a continuous narrative that refers to the history of the place but also takes into account needs, moods and prevailing fears and concerns in the affected population groups. In this context, the ITC project is intended to examine in particular the possibilities of virtual and augmented reality. Here, on the one hand, reference can be made to the literature and publications, on the other hand, to the knowledge already gained from projects by the Visual Narrative research group, the Immersive Realities Research Lab and the Institute for Socio-Cultural Development, Urban and Regional Development at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

One of the central dynamics in of the redesign and redefinition of current cultural landscape is the transformation of cities and landscapes from the point of view of experience and image optimization. Even suburban zones and agglomerations such as Ebikon are currently being reinvented, cultivated and upgraded. The transformation of everyday worlds into leisure and adventure worlds, as known from tourism, is taking place today on different levels and under different circumstances, both in the urban centers and in the rural peripheries. Tourist forms of culture and experience consumption have long shaped daily life and lead to the formation of new forms of everyday culture. In the “Central Switzerland” investigation perimeter, a whole series of paradigmatic – projected or already realized – “experience worlds” can be identified, for example from “Future Valley Lucerne” (Rontal) with the Ebisquare shopping and wellness center currently being implemented to the internationally established KKL Lucerne and the associated festival culture, the Göschenen/Andermatt region with a planned large resort and the attempt to promote gentle, natural tourism in the Göschenen valley with the Water Worlds project, through to the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch. In this respect, the Central Switzerland region can be seen as a model region, where very contrasting local and global influences and actors with very different reference systems and needs form an increasingly heterogeneous and multi-layered “cultural space” in a very small are Ebikon, Engelberg and Entlebuch.

In this project, a new financing instrument (""energy loan"") is being examined, which could complement the existing state funding and the promotional loans offered by the private sector. The basic idea is to create an opportunity for cheap, long-term loans for energy renovations, which will result in the return on investment being higher than with loans available on the market. The loan term would ideally be close to the life of the investment made; for facade renovations and heating replacements, this would be between 20 and 40 years, for example. To date, there have been no financing instruments in Switzerland with such a long time horizon, as such investments are classified by the capital market as unsafe and risky. The public sector could step in here with a new public-private partnership in order to make such systems possible with a form of security that has yet to be defined. The public sector would thus act as an ""enabler"" and could thus make energy modernization possible, which would not be carried out without this safeguard. This project examines which benefits can be achieved with these energy loans, whether and if so, which adjustments are necessary in lending, what risks are associated with this for the public sector, and ultimately whether there is a demand for such energy loans. The project is directly linked to an Innosuisse flagship project entitled ""Renowave"" (Massive Decarbonisation of the Swiss Building Stock) and examines in particular the role and the possibilities that a canton (specifically: the canton of Lucerne) in such a public-private partnership could have."," Habermacher Florian,  Drometer Marcus,  Ineichen Reto,  Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne"," Gallati Justus,  Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne"

In this project, the functions that the regional centers have for the surrounding area were first examined and processed from a regional economic perspective on the basis of a theory-based study. Based on this, the importance of the regional center for the rural surroundings was examined in a case study in the Sursee region. Guided interviews were conducted with representatives of the region, regional trade and larger companies. On the one hand, the individual company was the subject of the investigation, on the other hand, the representatives of an interest group in the region were asked about their knowledge and experiences. The findings from Sursee make it clear that the importance of a regional center is divided into three areas. Firstly, the regional center is important due to its (regionally important) size (relative to the number of inhabitants). Secondly, its importance lies in the supply of the region with goods and services for daily and non-periodic needs, transport infrastructure, care and training infrastructure and leisure activities. Thirdly, companies in the manufacturing, export-oriented sector are located in the regional center, which (can) influence the economic performance of the entire region. Of these three areas, the first two only have indirect economic impulses for the region: they increase the attractiveness of the location for local businesses, export companies and the local population and are therefore also interpreted as ""promoting the economy"". Direct economic effects can be detached from the economic performance of (larger) companies. In the communities in the surrounding area, positive effects can arise for local and locally oriented businesses as well as for manufacturing, export-oriented companies (e.g. for businesses and companies along the same value chain). In addition, dynamic companies have a positive effect on the resident population (e.g. increase in the resident population due to an attractive range of companies and jobs).",, Inderbitzin Jürg

This empirical study examined which type of communication works best for the end user. When customers find out about sustainable holidays, should brochures have an emotional design? Or would you rather be informed rationally on this topic? Does a graphic help to explain the sustainability of the product and does it increase the likelihood of booking? In order to answer such questions, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts conducted an empirical survey in four countries (Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain and the USA) with at least 750 people each. The most important findings can be summarized as follows: Sustainability should be communicated emotionally. Storytelling, active formulations, direct addressing and the use of adjectives are well received. Rational explanations are not persuasive, and graphics explaining the sustainability of a product are actually reluctant to be seen in holiday brochures. Only customers who have already booked sustainable trips are more open to more detailed explanations and information that are communicated rationally and objectively and possibly presented using a graphic. The second part of the study examines how the carbon offsetting of flights can best be integrated into a travel product. First, it would be possible to include it in the total price and thus automatically compensate when purchasing the product; second, the calculation with the option for the customer to reject the compensation and thus the surcharge (opt-out procedure); or thirdly, the possibility for the customer to actively buy the compensation by paying a surcharge (opt-in procedure). Here are the results: Around two thirds of the test persons preferred the integration of CO2 compensation for their flight into their sustainable travel product (Switzerland with 70% in second place after Germany with 71%, Great Britain with 69% and the USA with 63%). The integration should preferably be included in the calculation, but the customer should have the option of rejecting the compensation (through an opt-out procedure). In Switzerland, this was the preferred variant for 53.9% (Germany 49.2%, Great Britain 58.5%, USA 56%)"," Rosenberg Barbara,  Hausmann Christin,  Oechslin Dorothea,  Schaffner Dorothea,  MacKevett Douglas,  Truniger Fred,  Priskin Julianna,  Schwarz Jürg,  Stettler Jürg,  Zemp Myrta,  Amstad Olivia,  Abplanalp Richard,  Demarmels Sascha,  Kolberg Sonja", Wehrli Roger

The results for interested municipalities and cities are summarized in a handbook. In three series of experiments in Lucerne and Zurich, projects for the cultural and social development of the city districts are being developed and tested in close cooperation between artists, residents and the administration. From the knowledge gained, the research team, led by the Lucerne School of Art & Design, is developing a tool that systematizes the results and is intended to facilitate the inclusion of art in urban development processes in the future. The tool therefore includes step-by-step instructions, as well as a collection of reference examples and further links and literature. Urban axes as problematic spaces The focus is on three urban axes that are subject to multiple loads, because they are used as traffic arteries, places to shop, work and live at the same time. Wehntalerstrasse and Hohlstrasse in Zurich and the Kasernenplatz-Reussbühl axis in Lucerne are examples of this problem. Three different procedures are being tested on each of the three axes and implemented on two of the axes (Wehntalerstrasse and Kasernenplatz-Reussbühl). The procedures test different forms of involving the population with the aim of strengthening the identification of the residents with the place. “Search for traces” test series, Kasernenplatz–Reussbühl axis, Lucerne In the “Search for traces” test series, two teams of artists have the task of working in close contact with the local population to develop perspectives for the joint design of their surroundings. At so-called axis meetings, they are supported by local initiatives and associations, as well as the city of Lucerne and the research team. “Carte Blanche” test series, Wehntalerstrasse axis, Zurich For the “Carte Blanche” test series, eight residents of Wehntalerstrasse form a committee of neighborhood experts who select those artists who can implement a project. Five positions were selected from ten suggestions and presented their projects at a public event. In consideration of a 'public voting', the committee of district experts has selected two proposals with the help of self-developed criteria, which will be implemented by autumn 2014. ""Cooperation with administration"" test series, Hohlstrasse axis, Zurich In the ""Cooperation with administration"" test series, seven representatives of the administration (urban development, office for urban planning, police department, green city of Zurich and civil engineering office) worked together with three artists/teams. The aim was to be able to take up the potential of such cooperation for future processes of urban development. In three workshops, expectations of the use of art and finally the projects themselves were discussed."," Nägeli Bettina,  Wyss Jean-Marc,  Kolb Lucie,  Odermatt Mühlebach Markus,  Spillmann Peter,  Steiner Thomas,  Kluser Vera", Mader Rachel

In the first phase of the project, a process model was developed to promote the strategic structural development of a district in the interests of all those involved. For this purpose, proven methods for activating location-specific potentials were combined. The key lies in a broadly based, overarching development concept for the district and in exemplary construction projects that support and make this visible. After the development of the ""ImmoSol - process model for the strategic structural development of districts"" in the university-internally funded development phase, the model was used in the pilot project ""Solothurn West"" and thereby checked and specified. Using a so-called ""district branding"", a broadly based, overarching development plan was drawn up with those involved and affected, which was reflected in a master plan. On this basis and via small-scale development concepts and exemplary construction projects, the property owners and investors are involved in the joint process. The ""ImmoSol master plan"" developed in this way forms a bridge between functional and emotional aspects such as quality of life, integration, culture, atmosphere, etc. by combining ""hard"" measures (structural interventions on buildings, in public spaces, etc.) with ""soft"" measures (participatio communication, advice, networking, etc.) combined for upgrading and development. Its aim is to coordinate the findings from district development and the requirements for structural development and to make them available as a basis for a joint strategy and the revision of local planning. The master plan also shows visions and does not claim to be fully implemented in the medium term. This requires political decisions. The master plan should serve as a basis for decision-making. It builds on the quarter development process and the so-called ""quarter branding"". It shows measures at the planning, legal and cooperative levels. An important aspect is the designated development areas. In order to make these more concrete, the next step is to work out development concepts at the micro level. These can have different characteristics depending on the area, but should always be developed with the involvement of those affected."," Willener Alex,  Mayer Amelie-Theres,  Koller Fabienne,  Schumacher Jörg,  Lienhard Melanie,  Wandeler Moritz,  Baumeler Myriam,  Haase Stefan,  Sturm Ulrike", Steiner Thomas

In a P2P service exchange, private customers use the products or services of other private customers (to compensate for products or services from established companies), often mediated by an Internet platform, so-called P2P platforms. Examples can be found in tourism (Air-BnB, a platform where private accommodation can be booked), financial services (peer-to-peer lending / crowdfunding, i.e. the provision of loans from private individuals to private individuals), consumer goods (Sharel where commodities, eg drills, can be borrowed privately) or with services for daily needs (Mila, where craftsmen are hired, for example; Migros Sharoo: private car rental). If you look at the USA, which is often a pioneer and benchmark in this development, peer-to-peer economy offers can also be expected in other sectors, such as in the taxi industry through platforms for arranging private taxi rides. Even if the P2P markets seem like small niches today, many experts expect a fundamental restructuring of many areas of life and business through the peer-to-peer economy. There is some talk of a new economic paradigm. If this form of economy continues to gain in importance, the question arises as to what drives purchasing decisions in these contexts, what the success factors of P2P platforms are, or what the opportunities and risks of established companies are."," Schaffner Dorothea,  Federspiel Esther,  Boenigk Michael,  Breitenmoser Ria,  Mohr Seraina", Georgi Dominik

In rural areas, the aging and shrinking of the population often lead to competitive disadvantages, a lack of employment opportunities and insufficient diffusion of technologies. While young people usually find individual solutions for dealing with these structural problems, this is often not possible for older people or people with disabilities. In addition, there are fewer services and offers of help to support people in everyday life in rural areas. Coworking spaces are often found in creative cities. In recent years, however, coworking spaces in Switzerland have also been increasingly found in rural regions. From the point of view of regional development, coworking spaces contribute to the exchange of knowledge, innovation and cluster formation through the community. Coworking spaces can therefore also be an instrument to overcome the problems and challenges in rural areas. The ITC project systematically explores these possibilities and, after analyzing existing coworking spaces, deals with the question of how and under what conditions these can be used to improve social infrastructure and supply in rural areas.

The company has always strived to introduce innovative and energy-efficient household appliances to the market. Heat pumps for heating the water are integrated in modern dishwashers in order to significantly reduce the need for electrical energy compared to dishwashers with electrical resistance heating. Analyzes have nevertheless shown that the total electrical energy consumption can be further reduced, the duration of the washing program shortened and the water consumption reduced. Much of the knowledge gained here can be transferred to dishwashers without heat pumps. The two competence centers Thermal Energy Systems & Process Engineering and Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulic Machines supported V-ZUG AG in optimizing the heat pump and the drying process and in developing a new water pump. Various mathematical and physical simulation models were developed in the area of optimizing the heat pump and the drying process. With this help it is possible to examine and evaluate different concepts and configurations. This allows the most promising measures to be quickly identified and implemented. In addition, the effort for the experimental investigation can be significantly reduced. As a result, for example, a new type of condenser is available for the heat pump, which significantly reduces the logarithmic temperature difference of the heat transfer due to higher heat transfer coefficients. Furthermore, an evaporator was developed that is embedded in a latent heat storage device that is filled with phase change material. A new type of drying concept was developed for drying dishes, which envisages cooling down a dishwasher wall depending on the drying air temperature. The aim is to prevent fog in the dishwasher, which on the one hand impairs heat and mass transfer and on the other hand moistens dishes that are already dry. This drying concept is particularly suitable for dishwashers without heat pumps. The water pump is in operation throughout the wash program and consumes a significant amount of energy in modern, efficient dishwashers.

In nine interviews with professors from renowned music academies, the following joint descriptions of the «École française de clarinette» could be recorded: for four people, participation in the local music club during their school days was decisive for their later musical career. Some of them missed learning musical interpretation approaches in their basic training, but emphasize that today, as teachers, they combine basic technique with musical goals even in beginner lessons. Emphasized technical practice follows in higher levels. The French competition tradition has been cultivated in the classes from the very beginning. Solfège is compulsory outside of instrumental lessons. A uniform didactics of the basic technique can no longer be determined, as can be demonstrated in the teaching literature up to the 1930s. In general, however, great value is placed on the technique of vocalization (shaping the throat and oral cavity, conscious shaping and placement of the tongue depending on the pitch played) - a necessity that arises from the discrepancy between the vowels used in solfège and the tone-forming vowel formation when playing the clarinet (Billiards, 2018). From 1930 onwards, a move away from the double-lip attachment technique can be observed in France. The color and aesthetics of the sound also changed. The bright, brilliant playing, often accompanied by vibrato, fell out of fashion again from around 1960 when the «École française» became more similar to the «German School». Since then, a standardization in tone formation and the choice of similar mouthpieces and reeds can be observed. Michel Arrignon (2018) works internationally as a guest lecturer and laments the loss of tonal liveliness and characteristics in this development: «Cependant il ya actuellement en France et dans le monde entier, une obsession en faveur du son mat, lisse, impersonnel. Je pese mes mots, une obsession». Ramon Wodkowski (2018), who deals with the reconstruction of old French mouthpieces, says about this widespread concept of tone formation: ""dark but dead"". The teachers in Paris are familiar with the research work of IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique) relevant to clarinet playing. The results flow into her didactic-artistic practice (Arrignon, Verhaeghe, 2018). The traditionally cultivated collaboration between the major Parisian instrument makers and well-known teachers promotes a lively professional exchange in the development of instruments, mouthpieces and reeds. The interactions between musical practice, instrumental technique, tonal aesthetics and instrument making are in lively exchange here. The commercial interests of the instrument makers can also conflict with the aesthetic-artistic practice of their partners (Verhaeghe, 2018)."," Camp Marc-Antoine,  Kergomard Stephan", Mätzener Heinrich

In the Energy Strategy 2050, approved at the ballot in May 2015, Switzerland has defined ambitious goals, which include a transition of the energy system from fossil/nuclear towards renewable energies. However, the implementation of respective infrastructure projects has proven to be difficult and slow, not least due to political opposition and actors’ reluctance to invest in according projects. These challenges have been intensively discussed in the research on social acceptance of renewable energy infrastructure, where infrastructure for renewable energy production has been the focus of many studies.

HAAL studied the requirements of the target groups, developed concrete use cases and derived a set of human-centred services and implementation scenarios Contemporary Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) research produces quite complex, technology-driven solutions that often fail to satisfy the everyday needs of the humans they are targeted at. Our research project shows that there is a key difference between selectively using a particular technology, such as a computer or a mobile phone and living within (in some cases, at the mercy of) the technology embedded in a building that assists (or intrudes into) everyday life. The findings of the research indicate that the elderly want to remain as independent as possible and this includes being “assisted” by technology. Most understood that the time would come when they need assistance, however, but they had a preference for human assistance as much for the social contact as for the help itself. There was a general suspicion of the maturity of AAL and home automation technologies. The interview subjects had already experienced the “upgrade treadmill” with other technologies in the home and also doubted the reliability of AAL technologies. This, of course, led to the paradox that the technologies intended to help them be more independent would actually lead them to be more dependent on the engineers who installed and maintained this technology. Many also expressed a desire for a “simple mode,"" such as button that turned off or reset the house — an “out of the box” solution that did not need any setup. None of the interviewees were willing to engage in the steep learning curve of these new technologies, especially having already experienced enough user interface aggravation in their daily lives.",," Polaine Andrew,  Kistler Rolf"

In the SCCER “Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts” (FEEBD) at the iHomeLab, methods of machine learning are being developed in order to understand user behavior and thus increase the acceptance of building control. HSLU iHomeLab is leading two tasks within SCCER FEEB&D Phase II. In the first Task, methods are explored for the recognition of user activities in order to enable user-centric control strategies. First, insight is gathered about the interaction between the building control system and its occupants. Then, the most suitable solution (single- or multisensory) is determined for the reliable recognition of predetermined activities and behaviors. Finally, concepts are developed based on machine learning and sensor fusion in order to recognize the selected activities reliably. It is expected that up to five TWh/a could potentially be saved in Switzerland alone through user-centric building control systems. The second task takes place in collaboration with HSLU IGE. It is explored how data-driven building energy models can be automatically created and consecutively used for building characterization (“fingerprint”) and energy usage prediction. Data from various buildings of different types, both residential and functional, will thereby be used as input for the modelling task. The goal is to define energy fingerprints (i.e. typical behavior) of buildings automatically, and deviations from them. This in turn allows one to identify energy optimization opportunities and to predict electrical energy consumption of buildings that is driven by user behavior. The self-generation of building models will reduce the initial engineering cost for predictive control systems and therefore help to accelerate their market penetration."," Rumsch Andreas,  Paice Andrew,  Imboden Christoph,  Facchinetti Emanuele,  Thaler Eveline,  Ködel Joachim,  Fischer Ludger Josef,  Camenzind Martin,  Friedli Martin,  Vetterli Nadège,  Steiger Olivier,  Huber Mittler Patrick,  Schluck Thomas"," Mennel Stefan,  Steiger Olivier"

The goal of this ITC project is to elucidate how this institution can be leveraged to implement CE entrepreneurial opportunities at In the current global linear economic system, radical improvements can be achieved through the arrangement of the physical flows toward a more cyclical model, which is known as the Circular Economy (CE). The Ökihöfe are a role model for extensive recycling in Swiss municipalities and have become indispensable for their population. In practice, recovery can never be 100%. However, beyond recycling, other CE entrepreneurial opportunities exist (e.g. servitization) which may reduce the material throughput of the economic system. The goal of this ITC project is the submission of a proposal to Swiss Federal Office of Environment (FOEN). We propose to leverage the institution Ökihof as a springboard to promote and implement CE entrepreneurial opportunities at community level, thereby supporting the transition to CE. To this end, we study the role of four potential enablers of this transition: 1. Ökihof customers: They are adopters of new goods and services and show high loyalty culminating in cult-like devotion; 2. (Ökihof) digitalization: Digitalization is primarily an information revolution and, in the CE, the coordination of material and information flows are key. 3.

In the past two decades, many countries have undertaken reforms of their public financial management (PFM) systems. It was expected that strengthened PFM systems would contribute to achieve the three key PFM outcomes (i) aggregate fiscal discipline, (ii) strategic allocation of resources, and (iii) efficient ser-vice delivery. Many of the reform initiatives focused at the central government (CG), but increasingly involved subnational governments (SNGs). The shift towards SNGs happened in the context of transferring responsibilities and resources from the central to lower level of governments. Moreover, sub-national expenditure has been growing increasingly WorldBank (2013a). However, the majority of SNGs have not developed institutional capacities at the speed necessary to make them as effective in the provision of services that their citizens now demand (WorldBank, 2013b). It is the assumption that a greater focus on service delivery and, therefore, PFM in SNGs will lead to more effective service provision throughout the world and thereby contribute to achiev-ing the sustainable development goals (SDGs). With the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program, a framework for assessing and reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of PFM was established in 2005 (World Bank, 2005). An upgraded PEFA framework was published in 2016 (PEFA, 2016a). The PEFA 2016 Framework provides an overview of the PFM system and evidence-based measurement against 31 performance indicators (PI). Supplementary guidance for subnational PEFA assessment (PEFA, 2016b) offer recommendations on how each of the PEFA dimensions and indicators can be applied or modified to better suit the character-istics of subnational governments. In a recent analysis the PEFA Secretariat summarized that overall 244 PEFA assessments reports have been prepared at the subnational level, which have assessed 203 different SNGs (PEFA, 2018). Although the number of SNGs largely outnumber CGs, more PEFA assessments (352) were undertaken at CG level. Furthermore, the number of subnational PEFA assessment projects has only increased slowly in the past years and a large majority of the subnational PEFA assessment reports (57%) has been undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africa (ibid.). Against the background of greater importance of SNGs and their role in service delivery as well as rela-tively moderate applications of the PEFA framework at SNG level, the PEFA Steering Committee (SC) decided to develop and assess options for future application of PEFA Assessments in SNGs. It is expected that a revised PEFA framework for SNGs will better reflect variation in intergovernmental fiscal arrange-ments across countries and subnational units within countries (PEFA, 2018) to increase the framework’s relevance and usefulness for SNGs."," Z'Rotz Jana,  Pfäffli Stefan", Bruni Stefan

In times when the ‘economic’ seems to rule, artistic research is particularly suited to examine its possible flip sides, such as ornament. At the WOF, the World Ornamental Forum, a group of 22 artists, entrepreneurs, and researchers from disciplines ranging from architecture to organization studies, art research to history, or curating to philosophy, explored the potentials of a contemporary use of the ornamental as gesture. The parallel COMING-WOF first allowed for the virtual participation of those who could not be present in Davos and now, more importantly, allows appropriating other existing research structures and turning them into WOF research sites. WOF’s character constantly emerges from its critical but also self-deprecating take on the WEF, the World Economic Forum, in Davos. Our contention is that art has not lost its capacity to make us wonder. What if art’s critical potential did not start with critical intention but with empty space? Could ornament, interpreted as fugue, as ‘line of flight’, be in fact the rhizomatic ‘flow’ Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari evidence in their Thousand Plateaus (Mille plateaux, 1980), never stable and rocketing our imagination high through the ‘milieu’? The aim of the WOF is to regain a contemporary use of the ornamental as gesture and to practically explore and evidence the immeasurable value of such unproductive activity particularly with regard to contemporary concepts of work. WOF enacted the gestures of unproductive activity, which is not inactivity, by building the model of one’s own present situation. A series of objects and texts emerged from this paradoxical spatial experiment. Joshua Simon, Peg Rawes and Aoife Mac Namara made a users’ manual for the WOF by noting present activities. Christoph Zellweger put a cardboard circle into the snow injecting expandable construction foam underneath, thus creating an unpredictable object to be read like tea leaves. All the models evidenced immeasurable value through the discussions that followed as well as the on-going commitment by the participants. Our own research environment as the experimental set-up for the practical exploration of work made the fusion of outer research necessities with the researchers’ practical ethos possible. WOF is ideally and administratively connected to the Competence Centre of Arts Materials Research at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts’ School of Art & Design (Ronny Hardliz) and also supported by the Creative Living Lab of the university enabling the collaborations with the School of Business (Jens Meissner) and the School of Engineering and Architecture (Lars C.

All conversations that do not have a formal character, but occur ""on the side"" or ""en passant"" are considered informal communication: be it a chat during the coffee break, a conversation in the elevator, a spontaneous telephone call, a conversation over an aperitif after the official meeting etc. This informal communication hardly takes place when working together across different locations due to the physical distance and limited visibility. The Northwestern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences, together with Cisco, Post, Skan, Trivadis and Vitra, have therefore investigated how and under what conditions informal communication between different locations can be made possible virtually. To this end, a ""place for virtual informal communication"" was set up and tested in the individual companies, each at two separate locations. In order for such OviKs to be created, many factors have to be taken into account: space or location of the system, light, acoustics, furniture, technology, recording and playback conditions, associated organizational units, acceptance among employees, etc. Through the development and use of prototypes relevant success factors for the introduction of OviKs could be determined at the company locations of the business partners involved."," Schuchert Christian Lars,  Eckert Jan,  Luppino Nicolo,  Schwehr Peter,  Schmickl Raphaela,  Amstutz Sibylla", Heim Thomas

Industrial design and usability (usability engineering) work in strongly overlapping fields and also on the same artefacts: both plan and design interactive systems. Nevertheless, both fields have different roots and went through separate developments. This led to a lack of knowledge in the usability and HCI community regarding established theories and methods of design, which would be of great use for new product developments. An integration of design-theoretical concepts into the HCI is therefore indicated. For this purpose, in a first step in this project, current problems in dealing with digital devices and IoT applications are researched, analyzed and categorized and practical HCI experiments are designed. In addition to the practical relevance and easy transferability of the results to concrete tasks at the HCI, the focus of this ITC pilot project is on the intensive interdisciplinary exchange between colleagues from the three departments I, T&A and D&K, which is essential for working on the topic. In the sense of a ""transformative interdisciplinarity"", it is first necessary to develop a common understanding in order to develop connectable concepts based on this."," Nieke Clemens,  Uhr Marcel", Steffen Dagmar Johanna

Additional interviews with the actors involved (operators, representatives from cultural policy and administration) result in a condensed image of the assessments and visions of self-organization in the Swiss art scene. In the comparative analysis of the two work steps (documentation and interviews), the facts collected from the source materials are compared with the assessments determined in the interviews and related to the current cultural-political discourse along relevant keywords.

The SNSF research project 'What can art do? On the Relevance of Politically Engaged Art since 1960', a transdisciplinary team examines the complex relationship between current artistic practices and their social reality. Content and goal of the research project Political art has enjoyed growing resonance for several years. Numerous exhibitions, biennials, conferences and even courses of study are explicitly dedicated to politically engaged art practices, and archives and grants for activist art have also been created. All of these efforts are based on the assumption that art is relevant to society. Relevance was even raised to the central category of the assessment of artistic production, which it should have in relation to the respective addressees (population group, neighborhood, politics, etc.). Relevance is not a measurable quantity, but a discursively created value that is negotiated in the exchange between the actors who are endowed with the power of interpretation (artists, critics, art mediators, art scholars, philosophy). The aim of the project is to process and clarify the complex relationship between politically committed art practice and its counterpart, social reality. The disciplines involved in the negotiation (art, art history, philosophy/aesthetics, art education) are brought together in a transdisciplinary research team. In the five sub-studies, exemplary constellations (artistic practice, art-critical and art-historical reception) and their context (aesthetics and art history) are processed. The results of the research are published online in a vocabulary on art and politics.

Content and goal of the research project The way people live and are mobile is linked to attitudes, cultural expression, forms of social interaction, identification or different knowledge bases. Sociology has developed theories and methods that make group-specific regularities and differences visible and condense them into lifestyles. Differences in terms of mobility and housing thus become recognizable as characteristics of cultural and social groups. This project identifies energy consuming lifestyle groups in the Lucerne population and asks about their potential for sustainable behavior. For this purpose, models from psychology and marketing are included in an interdisciplinary approach. Finally, the environmental protection agencies receive tools that are already being used successfully in marketing or in prevention campaigns. In this way, the administration can identify the population's potential and needs for more sustainable behavior and promote it with targeted communication. Scientific and social context of the research project The research project combines sociological with behavioral and social psychological approaches. The methodology developed for typifying lifestyle groups in connection with mobility and household-related energy consumption can thus be further developed in line with the needs of the administration.

It was found that there are three points on the network where changes are particularly frequent, with Lucerne station alone accounting for almost two thirds of the changes. Another key finding was that more than half of all passengers never change planes at all. It can therefore be concluded that passengers generally tend to shy away from changing trains.

Various challenging situations are mentioned by the employees as the main stress in everyday work. In addition to a high level of job-specific training on the part of the employees, there is also a large proportion of employees who have no job-specific training. However, job-specific professional skills make a significant contribution to employees perceiving themselves as knowledgeable and experienced (cf. Calabrese/Georgi-Tscherry/Zenker 2017).

This increases the quality of the waste and reduces costs by minimizing rejects. The reduced waste also saves energy during production, which contributes to reducing CO2 emissions. Hyperspectral imaging offers sensitive, non-contact (non-invasive) analysis possibilities for various fields such as medicine (e.g. dermatology), food industry, raw material processing, industrial automation and others. Compared to the color camera, which essentially resolves three colors, hyperspectral imaging measures multiple and more finely resolved spectra, which can also include the near (non-visible) infrared range. Light interacts with matter in different ways and the interaction is wavelength dependent, resulting in a characteristic spectral fingerprint. With the hyperspectral camera, the wavelength spectrum of the received light is recorded per pixel in the imaging, which enables objects in the image area to be assigned physical and chemical properties. In contrast to classical spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging can measure large areas with high spatial resolution. The characteristic light scattering/reflection enables, for example, the detection of material categories (e.g. type of plastic), the monitoring of the degree of ripeness of individual fruits and other agricultural products, the identification of tumor tissue and measurement of blood flow in the skin as well as the large-scale characterization of thin layers."," Calatroni Alberto,  Andrushevich Aliaksei,  Paice Andrew,  Vera Benjamin,  Nieke Clemens,  Bolliger Daniel,  De Assunção Pestana Edgar,  Birrer Edith,  Parisi Filippo,  Kniesel Guido,  Juchli Lukas,  Biallas Martin,  Camenzind Martin,  Friedli Martin,  Huber Mittler Patrick,  Niederberger Stefan,  Winterberger Stefan", Eberle Patric

The smart speakers play music, provide weather forecasts, read entire audio books and control devices. Especially those who live in a house with building automation can use voice control to control blinds, lighting, cameras, energy, music and much more. But the intelligent language assistants have a disadvantage: they listen. Always. This is the only way they can react immediately when a request comes. As soon as the smart speaker has been activated by a so-called activation word (e.g. ""Ok Google""), the speech recognition and processing takes place in the cloud, which means that all data is transmitted over the Internet and stored on the providers' servers. Unintentional activations (e.g. through the television) or targeted attacks on the devices occur again and again, which means that sensitive data can get onto the Internet or even functions in the smart home can be controlled by unauthorized persons from outside. In this project we want to develop a secure language assistant. That means a language assistant that does not need any internet access or ""listening"" microphones. Instead, sensors take over this work by initiating communication with the building user in defined situations. The microphones for voice input are only briefly activated for the duration of the current dialogue. In this way, the system can proactively inquire about the current needs and plans of users, depending on the situation, and provide tips and information. We are convinced that the future belongs to voice-controlled and intelligent systems. With this project we want to go one step further and develop a system that can also meet the highest demands in terms of security, data protection and privacy."," Calatroni Alberto,  Rumsch Andreas,  Paice Andrew,  Vera Benjamin,  Nieke Clemens,  Bolliger Daniel,  von Arx Dieter,  Birrer Edith,  Vogel Manuel,  Biallas Martin,  Camenzind Martin,  Friedli Martin,  Wüthrich Martin,  Eberle Patric,  Huber Mittler Patrick,  Schranz Raphael,  Niederberger Stefan,  Winterberger Stefan", Kniesel Guido

In a reanalysis of the data material from the previous project ""Employees in intensive care"", these are to be determined more precisely. Intensive care is a special setting in disability support that was developed specifically for people with disabilities and massively challenging behavior or behavioral problems. The work in intensive care is demanding and the employees may be exposed to a variety of stresses. For this reason, the research project ""Employees in intensive care"" determined which competence profile employees in intensive care should have and to what extent they could be supported in their daily work. The research project ""Competence profile and need for support of employees in intensive care"", which was completed in November 2017 and was carried out in cooperation with the HfH, contains a lot of data. Institutions in German-speaking Switzerland and Lichtenstein took part in the survey that show intensive care for people with cognitive impairments and challenging behavior. The data material consists of a quantitative survey of managers and employees as well as qualitative interviews with managers, employees and clients of the intensive care. The data material has already been analyzed with regard to the skills and support needs of employees. However, it is well suited for carrying out further reanalyses, since many additional aspects came into play in the qualitative interviews in particular. With regard to intensive care offers and setting, important and practice-relevant questions are currently being asked. The reanalysis is intended to shed light on aspects of high-quality care and support work in intensive care (1), the views of the clients surveyed on beneficial and hindering aspects of intensive care in relation to their quality of life (2) and the professional-ethical areas of conflict within intensive care. The following questions are central to the reanalysis: To what extent does high-quality support and support work in intensive care succeed from the point of view of the employees? Which beneficial and hindering aspects of intensive care do the clients surveyed perceive in relation to their quality of life? Which professional-ethical areas of tension do employees and managers of intensive care experience and how do they deal with them?"," Fiala Elisa,  Georgi-Tscherry Pia"," Calabrese Stefania,  Georgi-Tscherry Pia"

Interprofessionalism means that specialists from different disciplines and professions work together in a coordinated and closely coordinated manner. Both in research and in practice, the improvement and strengthening of interprofessional cooperation is discussed as a possible solution to improve the so-called ""interface problem"". Various studies indicate that by promoting interprofessionalism, the quality of care can be increased and the cost-efficient use of resources can be promoted. In addition, the satisfaction of the specialist staff should be increased and early retirement should be avoided.

Social work has changed a lot in recent years. To what extent does the tripartite division still make sense today? To what extent is the traditional division of social work into social work, social pedagogy and socio-cultural animation still relevant and meaningful in Switzerland today? Interviews with specialists from education and social work as well as theoretical considerations should help to answer this question. The project team investigated whether the three-way division still makes sense or whether it would be better to replace it with other differentiations. To this end, it conducted theoretical reflections and guided interviews with experts from the field and from universities. Both theoretically and empirically, two answers can be derived with good reason: sticking to the traditional tripartite division as well as its task and consequently replacing it with social work per se. While the first option calls for new justifications that are adapted to changes in professional practice, those who choose the second option have to find and present new differentiations. In order to be able to justify such answers convincingly, a clarified methodological self-understanding is necessary. The project also resulted in a method reflection. The explanations are rounded off by an appendix that documents the current situation at three universities of applied sciences with generalist training (Bern, Zurich, Northwestern Switzerland) and just as many with differentiated training (St. Gallen, Lucerne, Valais). This makes an important contribution to professional identity in the social sector, which can form the basis for the design of curricula.

SwissLAB 2016 takes place in the Zurich airport region. Airport locations can no longer be understood as point sizes. The expressions ""Airport City"" and ""Airport Region"" point to this new, expansive reality of facilities originally conceived as purely physical infrastructure. Today, airports are locations that, like cities, regions or entire nations, are part of a higher-level network of relationships and thus compete for locations. It is no coincidence that those internationally oriented major airports that are part of a global system are also located in major regions that are now emerging as ""mega-city regions"". Such hub airports open up spaces that include the engines and most important actors of economic development as well as the living space in which the pollution evoked by the airport - such as aircraft and road noise - occurs.

This paper consumption is to be curbed with the help of an app. In the future, the grades will be submitted digitally by the students and presented to the jury on tablets during the examination. This form of digitization and its possible influence on the examination situation is tested in the department before the app is programmed in selected examinations and then evaluated with the help of interviews with people involved. The lecturers are introduced to the operation of the tablet and the software used beforehand. The planned app should also simplify official channels, for example the direct digital submission of examination reports and the entry of grades should be made possible. So far, this has been done on paper and then scanned. The greatest consideration is given to security and confidentiality. Furthermore, it has not been clarified consistently and conclusively which criteria are to be used when evaluating the examinations and how the impression of the commission is to be communicated to the students. The topic is complex, because pressing music into a fixed scheme could not do justice to the desired individuality. However, an interview study with main subject lecturers at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts showed that lecturers would certainly welcome support in developing the assessment and formulating structured feedback.

Evaluation criteria and scale as well as properties of the app are derived from the findings of the interview study in order to closely reflect the needs and wishes of the lecturers. Lecturers are introduced to the app in a workshop. After internal tests, the app is used and validated over a semester in real final exams. The app is intended to make the assessment of final exams easier, it acts as a template for the grading process by the commission, but does not claim to replace it.

The models were validated using measurement data from a SFOE-financed project. KVS are typical WRG in ventilation and air conditioning systems. Compared to other heat recovery systems, KVS requires a lot of electrical auxiliary energy. The circulation pump of the water-glycol intermediate circuit is mainly responsible for the increased energy consumption. With the help of simulations, optimal designs with energy-efficient operation can be achieved. In the master's thesis ""Simulation-supported optimization of circulatory systems in ventilation and air-conditioning systems"", the optimal planning and functioning of KVS is shown using simulations and numerical optimization. For this purpose, the empirical data of a reference KVS were used. These were determined over the course of a year. The measurement data formed the basis for the validation of the simulation model. Various structures and control strategies were tested and optimized in the simulation. The investigations have shown that there is potential for optimization in planning and operation. The planners and the operators are addressed equally. Basically, there is no recipe for how KVS should be planned and operated, as the area of application is very different. Nevertheless, there are rules that must be observed and circumstances that must be taken into account when making a decision in the planning. Most of the rules apply to simple KVS and KVS networks. Easy to implement but influential optimizations for all KVS are: The optimal water-glycol mass flow must be controlled based on the air mass flow. A speed-controlled pump is required for this. A two-way valve must be installed in the bypass for frost protection operation. The total pressure loss can thus be reduced without disadvantages. The straight-way valve must be designed based on the pressure loss in partial load operation (max. 30-40% of the water-glycol mass flow) of the air heater. The flow of the water-glycol mass flow in the heat exchanger must not be laminar at the minimum mass flow. A large spread between minimum and maximum air volume flow resp. Water-glycol mass flow must be prevented so that the pressure loss at maximum flow rate is not extremely high.

In Germany there are over 591,000 SMEs, which make up 99.7 percent of the companies and 67 percent of all jobs. Due to this economic and social importance, the financial situation of SMEs is also of particular interest. In order to periodically analyze the financing situation of Swiss SMEs, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has commissioned several surveys in recent years. Based on this, studies were developed that answer various questions in connection with the financing situation. Another survey was carried out in spring 2021, on which the findings presented here are based. A total of 2,712 Swiss SMEs were asked about their financing needs and their types, sources and conditions of financing. In addition, there were two special parts of the survey on the two topics ""Effects of the Corona crisis on SMEs"" and ""Movable and intangible assets as loan collateral"".

Data centers are energy-intensive and relatively inefficiently operated infrastructures. The study assumes an unused efficiency potential of 46%. Context Energy Perspectives 2050 The decarbonization or the reduction of CO2 emissions goes hand in hand with the electrification of the building stock and, together with the dismantling of the nuclear power plants by 2035, poses a challenge for a secure and as independent as possible power supply at all times. Data centers are known to be not only «24/ 7 consumers», but also very sensitive when it comes to security of supply. In this respect, it is important that both existing and new data centers are operated and designed as energy-efficiently as possible. This means that the connected load should be conceptually minimized and the parameters optimized during operation. Both of these hardly ever happen today, especially since there are neither normative nor official requirements. Despite international standards (eg ASHRAE, USA, 2004) and the commitment of the IT industry, the topic still does not seem to have reached the attention of building owners and planners even after 15 years. The current BFE study is in line with the basics and information campaigns and funding programs published since 2004, but draws a sobering conclusion: 46% untapped potential. Competence and Consistency First of all, it should be noted that in the field of data centers two worlds meet that do not cultivate an interdisciplinary discourse. On the one hand the IT world, which only cares about the operational reliability of the servers, and on the other hand the construction world, which does not know the requirements of the IT components. So there is a lack of holistic competence, a basic requirement for generating systemic solutions with high energy efficiency. It is time that the demands of the IT processes were better coordinated with the possibilities of the on-site infrastructure and that consistent solutions were generated. For example, it is inexplicable why the waste heat from the data centers in Switzerland, with a few exceptions, is still dissipated using mechanical chiller processes and not 100% using free cooling.

In cooperation with the HSLU, the various rooms of the small theater will be virtually reproduced so that they can also be played in virtual reality. The small theater invites interested artists to a workshop in autumn 2021, where they can experience initial contact with the new technologies. As a result, groups of artists are selected in order to be able to adapt their work to this new platform under the guidance and supervision of research groups from the HSLU Computer Science and Design & Art and to acquire the necessary tools. The plays will then be presented to a broad public in a digital theater festival from April 4 to 9, 2022."," Smolic Aljosa,  Vogelsang Axel,  Lanfranconi Dario,  Woods Janina,  de Diesbach Simon,  Nguyen Thi Anh Ngoc"," Wetzel Richard,  Vogelsang Axel"

According to the National Center for Climate Services NCCS, the mean annual temperature in Switzerland could rise by 3.3 - 5.4 °C by the end of the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unchecked[1]. In the future, this development could have a massive impact on the energy requirements (particularly cooling) and comfort (increase in hot days) of buildings. In order to continue to guarantee a high level of living comfort and energy-efficient operation over the entire life cycle of buildings, reduction and adaptation measures (adaptation and mitigation) are necessary. The greening of buildings can become increasingly important in view of climate change, especially in urban areas. The advantages are manifold, but above all they make a contribution to cooling the outside air. PV systems convert solar energy into electricity. A major advantage of a PV façade compared to a PV roof system is the higher energy yield in the winter months due to the seasonally low angle of inclination of the sun. Thus, the previously low domestic electricity production in winter can be increased by PV facades. This could make an important contribution to the Energy Strategy 2050 in the future. While the advantages of greenery and PV systems in the roof area are already being increasingly used, the high potential of building facades has so far remained largely untapped. This is where the project comes in. The obstacles and acceptance regarding the use of these systems in the facade area are examined. Based on existing literature, simulations and measurements, there should be indications of the influence of different facade systems on the microclimate of the building and the energy balance in the building and these should be compared with the potential for energy generation and synergies should be shown. Based on this analysis, recommendations for optimal use of the facade are then formulated. Financial, energetic, creative, social and environmental aspects play a role. The results are then processed in the form of practical solutions.

The focus is on the everyday dynamics and processes that lead to a suicide attempt. On average, lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* youth (LGBT) are more affected by suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts than the heterosexual and cis-gender population[1]. In Switzerland there is a lack of qualitative studies that deal in depth with the everyday life and biographical dynamics of LGBT youth and their help-seeking behavior before attempting suicide. However, in-depth knowledge of these dynamics would be necessary in order to optimize measures, offers and structures of suicide prevention with regard to an LGBT-sensitive orientation. A qualitative study that promises good follow-up options for suicide prevention practice is complex and raises questions regarding implementation (e.g. with regard to the security of the survey, recruitment of those affected and their environment). Therefore, in a preliminary study/feasibility study, it is clarified whether and how a possible later and extensive qualitative research project on LGBT young people in Switzerland could be implemented.

A look back shows that this development has been discontinuous: the initiation of the first independent chamber music concerts exactly 150 years ago lasted only a decade, subsequent efforts of a similar kind can be dated to the founding of the Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft Luzern in 1929. Chamber music in Lucerne finally received a noticeable, didactic boost at the beginning of the 1940s with the beginning of the era of master classes at the International Music Festival and in connection with the founding of the conservatory at that time. On the one hand, the project wanted to focus on this historical perspective of chamber music cultivation in Lucerne and retrospectively illuminate the stations of this development.

The organization of family life, sexuality, reproduction and, in general, personal self-determination raise questions in practice that are not always easy to answer. Social work professionals are often confronted with questions and dilemmas that cannot be easily resolved. In addition to restrictions, people with disabilities are also confronted with all kinds of discrimination in their everyday lives. Their rights to equal treatment are anchored in the federal constitution, the Disability Equality Act, in cantonal constitutions and last but not least in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there is always a lack of appropriate measures in the concrete implementation or the sensitization of the environment for the special living situation of people with a disability. This sometimes also applies to the way professionals and institutions deal with these people. In addition to legislation and a social policy that is conscious of equality, organizations for disabled people and the authorities are also required to recognize equality for people with disabilities as a fundamental right and to ensure conditions in everyday life that enable those affected to claim their fundamental rights as best as possible take.

However, offers of help are often not tailored to their needs. In the project we are therefore investigating their accessibility. People with physical, psychological, cognitive and sensory impairments have a particularly high risk of experiencing violence in their immediate social environment (including institutions) and in public spaces. Although there are many different offers in Switzerland for people affected by violence in general and for people with disabilities affected by violence, these offers are often not accessible to people with disabilities, specialists do not feel responsible for this group of clients and/or they are only rarely adapted to the needs of this population group. On behalf of the Federal Office for Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities, we are therefore investigating the accessibility and accessibility of support services for people with disabilities who have been affected by violence. Based on the findings, recommendations for improving the accessibility and accessibility of the offers are derived. The project is based on the requirements from the postulate 20.3886 (Roth) ""Violence against people with disabilities in Switzerland"" of June 19, 2020, whereby the work is based on the work package defined by the EBGB ""Ensuring low-threshold and barrier-free access to offers of help for those affected by violence people with disabilities».

Methods for assessing glare from daylight in buildings are indispensable when planning high-performance buildings that are intended to combine energy efficiency with a high quality of stay. They play a special role in building simulation, since they do not refer to zones defined spatially and according to use, but instead examine the effects on an imaginary person with a known position and viewing direction on the basis of computer-generated or photographic images. The glare assessment based on simulated light fields promises a more comprehensive understanding of glare as a function of the spatial variables of position, viewing direction and the temporally variable external daylight conditions."," Plörer Daniel,  Schregle Roland,  Wasilewski Stephen", Grobe Lars Oliver

Breast pumps for nursing mothers were originally developed for the clinical context. Since then, however, the technical appearance of the existing product concepts has hardly been able to emancipate itself from medical aesthetics, even though these products have found their way from the hospital into the everyday life of mothers and small children as a result of changes in social and political structures. Expressing breast milk can often become a source of stress for mothers for medical and social reasons, which in turn can impede milk production. The CTI project 16931.1 PFES-ES Medela - Emotion Through Textiles investigated the possibilities for the extensive integration of textile materials in breastfeeding and pumping products. The aim was to use textile-based product concepts to make pumping more comfortable and more integrative, to relieve mothers emotionally and to lengthen breastfeeding periods. The project is a collaboration between the Product & Textile research group and the company Medela AG. The result is a product concept in two variants of a multifunctional bra. The product concepts could be processed on a material, production and design level, realized as prototypes and checked for their feasibility. Specifically, the research project has provided solutions for the following core criteria: Simplification: product concept for every situation soft materialization: body-hugging materials become textile more discretion: silhouette-based product design A cross-technology approach was pursued as the methodical guiding principle in the project. This promoted the work with functional diagrams and patent research. In workshops with expert groups, user needs were identified and reformulated into project goals.

Furthermore, the requirements of the SMEs for the chat training should be formulated so that in the future they can sensitize and train employees in a targeted manner on topics related to financial literacy. According to our study partner HSLU, various studies have shown that many SMEs are overwhelmed by supporting their employees on this topic without external help and would like offers and support in this regard. Our own experiences with Swiss SMEs have also shown that in many cases little or nothing is done to deal with the topic of financial literacy in SMEs, as there is often a lack of time or human resources to deal with this topic in a sustainable and meaningful way. We consider the chatbot-based transfer of knowledge in this area to be necessary and extremely helpful, as in many cases negative effects on employees due to financial ignorance can be avoided and the often heavily stressed human resource departments can be relieved. Greater financial knowledge leads to better investment decisions and generally better money management, which leads to a higher standard of living. Imparting financial knowledge is therefore a social commitment on the part of the employer for its employees. With the help of short and sympathetically designed chat-based training courses, the employees of Swiss SMEs are first to be made aware of and then trained in the topic of financial education, especially with regard to old-age provision.

The basic idea of the ""thermal networks"" came from the idea of compensating for locally separate surpluses with a shortfall. The ""Overall Energy Planning"" stimulus program aims to improve knowledge of holistic concepts in energy supply. Based on investigations and approaches from the field of ""cold district heating"" and ""anergy networks"", the field of action for ""thermal networks"" is expanded to include all operating temperatures of supply systems. The aim of the ""Thermal Networks"" program is to expand and coordinate the knowledge of all players in the field of energy supply. The SFOE is the initiator of the “Thermal Networks” program. The actors involved in the ""Thermal Networks"" program are: Spatial planners: Responsible for spatial planning and, consequently, for energy planning at object, area and district level in the communities. Investors: Interested in the return of capital and long-term value retention of buildings, and thus in energy supply concepts that are sustainable in the long term. Planner: The role of the planner as a coordinator will become more important in the future. A sustainable energy supply requires thermal networks at an appropriate temperature level in order to connect producers and consumers.

Chatbots on (banking) websites are nothing new anymore. Many companies also try to build a relationship between the user and the chatbot by using emojis. However, the use of emotions and emojis has so far been very general and not adapted to the individual user. Initial research in the field of psychology shows that chatbots do not want emotions in all situations and for all users. We would now like to find out in detail when chatbot emotions are helpful for the chat conversation and when they are more harmful. If emotions prove to be useful, it should be found out which exact emotions the chatbot should show. To date, no productive chatbot is known in the financial sector that can adapt its emotions or tonality individually to user emotions and needs. So far, research in this area has not been comprehensive either, but always only considers individual use cases or individual target groups. In reality, it is usually the case that the financial companies mostly focus on the content of the chatbot, but exclusively on the thematic content (e.g. products), not on content that is relevant to the user experience. The technology providers, on the other hand, mostly focus on technical elements, which, however, do not exclusively focus on the user experience.

This gave the eastern part of the canton of Lucerne a direct motorway connection to Zurich and beyond for the first time. With the closure of the A4 gap in the Knonaueramt in 2010, important questions arose for Lucerne's economy and politics, especially with regard to location positioning and cooperation strategies. For this reason, the Economic Forum selected the closing of the gap in the A4 motorway in the Knonaueramt and its possible development impulses for the Lucerne location as the first topic to be deepened and commissioned the Institute for Business and Regional Economics IBR of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts to deal with this issue. The Business Forum of the Lucerne Economic Development Agency wants to recognize and actively tackle the associated opportunities and challenges for Lucerne as a location. In addition to identifying possible effects of the new motorway section, the aim of the study was therefore above all to derive options for action and relevant actors for the targeted control of these developments. The following was stated: - With the completion and commissioning of the new section of the A4 motorway in Knonaueramt in spring 2010, Lucerne will be directly connected to the new Zurich-West traffic triangle and, further north, to the Limmat Valley and Kloten Airport. - With the improved accessibility via the A4, the markets in the greater Lucerne and Zurich areas are moving noticeably closer. The improvements in accessibility through the A4 are positive for the attractiveness of Lucerne as a location, but are not enough as a convincing argument. - Economic development on the ""white-blue axis"" from Lucerne via Zug to Zurich requires a more efficient overall transport system. Ensuring accessibility is also of central importance for the development of Lucerne as a place to live and work. - The increased cooperation with the cantons of Zurich and Aargau postulated in the government council's ""Strategy 2020"" gains additional importance in many respects with the opening of the A4 in the Knonaueramt. - In addition to the visible and direct effects, the new motorway connection through the Knonaueramt also has a mental effect.",, Hauser Christoph

With the prevention project ≪Health Competence Thanks to Self-Help Friendliness≫, Self-Help Switzerland promotes cooperation between self-help groups and the health care system. From 2021 to 2024, the aim is to build up regional cooperation between hospitals, regional self-help centers and self-help groups across Switzerland in order to develop and implement hospital-specific measures for more self-help friendliness. The aims of the project are to make known the joint self-help of patients, relatives and specialists as a supplement to hospitalization and as an aftercare offer and to strengthen the exchange between specialists and patients and relatives. With the support of innovative PGV projects, Health Promotion Switzerland is striving for the overriding goal of ""strengthening prevention in healthcare across the entire supply chain in order to promote the quality of life and autonomy of patients and to reduce the need for treatment"". The PGV projects are thus part of the implementation of the National Strategy for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD Strategy).

With qualitative methods (participant observation, qualitative interviews), five selected cooperation projects are deepened as case studies. The evaluation focuses on three main areas: firstly, the summative part focuses on the effects of the project on the people in the cooperation teams (multipliers I) and on the specialists in the hospital (multipliers II). The second focus is the investigation of the causal relationships, which is appropriate due to the large number and diversity of the cooperation projects. Third, in the formative part of the evaluation, attention is paid to the design of the cooperation in the cooperation teams (including interprofessionalism, opportunities for patients and their families to participate)."," Haefeli Bettina,  Lehmann Elina,  Jehle Kathrin,  Eder Manuela,  Kessler Oliver,  Wyss Sabrina"," Lischer Suzanne,  Wyss Sabrina"

Data plays a crucial role in this context. While financial data is easily quantifiable and available in databases in a structured form, access to non-financial data and thus also to ESG information poses a challenge due to the scattered availability and complexity. Texts in particular have to be prepared and analyzed here. This would be very time-consuming to do manually. This problem is to be solved in this research project. We analyze corporate sustainability reports and press articles on ESG issues. With the help of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), texts can be more easily understood. They can be used by companies as an analysis tool and early warning system. The aim of the research project is, on the one hand, to measure the stakeholder orientation of companies and to compare the ESG topic focus of companies with the requirements of external stakeholders.

The new conditions require an appropriate conception during the planning and construction of new areas, buildings and spaces in order to ensure high-quality (post-)densification and targeted mixing on the structural level . The research project therefore answers the following question on the basis of case studies: Which spatial and structural design of buildings and intermediate spaces takes into account the new, dense mixed use ""urban areas"" and their future change? The answers are summarized in structural strategies in order to negotiate, plan, implement and operate adaptable urban qualities for urban areas in the future. The project sees itself in the context of previous urban development research and provides answers in the quality discourse of urban density. Consequences for buildings and upgrading of the public (intermediate) space are researched, the terms ""density"" and ""mixed use"" are filled with concrete suggestions and illustrated on the basis of spatial situations and compared with the valid model building regulations.

It launches a diversity and inclusion benchmark. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts acts as the leading institution. With the development and implementation of diversity and inclusion benchmarking, the participating universities are breaking new ground. The aim of the project is an independent and meaningful evaluation of key personnel figures and student data along different dimensions of diversity. In addition, an anonymous comparison of all participating universities is to be carried out, which enables a comparison over time and the development of the universities (as an ""industry""). For this purpose, a set of indicators relevant for the universities will be developed, selected indices for the university context will be defined and diversity controlling will be anchored at the universities involved. The initiative thus supports systematic diversity monitoring at Swiss universities and, by clarifying the synergy potential with data from the Federal Statistical Office and the Swiss University Information System, initiates the important discussion about the basics of federal education monitoring and about a common goal orientation when collecting data. Concrete benchmarking evaluates existing data in a new, independent and meaningful way. Selected indices for the university context generate significant added value compared to previous HR key figure reporting. In addition to the relevant function levels among employees, student data is also analyzed by department. This is intended to use the cascade model to determine the potential of junior staff that needs to be optimally exploited. The benchmarking shows the individual universities their strengths and their need for action in terms of equal opportunities. Fact-based analyzes can reveal the key points at which managers can make a concrete contribution to inclusion or to optimally exploit the potential through their decisions. Corresponding recommendations for action and possible goals for management at the universities ultimately set impulses for university development. In addition to benchmarking, the participating universities can conduct an employee and/or student survey on the climate of inclusion or analyze existing surveys from a diversity perspective. The combination of benchmarking and surveys offers a comprehensive organizational analysis that supports the universities in defining goals and measures tailored to them. The development of the indicators is the responsibility of a working group made up of representatives of the participating universities and the Competence Center for Diversity & Inclusion of the University of St. Gallen. The project is very popular in the Swiss university landscape. 18 educational institutions have already signaled their participation. In addition, the umbrella organization swissuniversities would like to use the indicators resulting from the project as a basis for reflection for the development of a national diversity strategy after 2020.",, Siska Blanka

With the demand for economical use of the soil, coexistence will change permanently. The aim should be to use significantly less land per capita. In view of the current growth in claims, however, this is not easy to implement. In any case, most of them only agree to move closer together if their apartment doesn't get smaller. Unless another added value is offered. Because living does not only take place in the apartment, but also in front of the house and in the living environment. It is known from architectural psychology that the existing or lacking interaction and communication control over one's own environment affects the feeling of available space and thus the perceived density. The project is based on the thesis that available space is both a question of structural-spatial design and usage regulations, which control the residents' control over their own environment and support the appropriation potential of architecture. The focus of the project is on the so-called compensation spaces – i.e. spaces that compensate for the reduction in private living space. Examples include semi-private forecourts or outdoor spaces that can be used and designed in a variety of ways, thus expanding the residents' scope for action. The architectural framework is just as much a prerequisite for this as house rules that support this scope. The exploratory study is intended to provide information on how structural, spatial and regulatory measures can positively influence the feeling of available space in dense housing estates and enable negotiable fields of experimentation."," Geissbühler Dieter,  Hansch Franziska,  Winterberger Franziska,  Malevez Jara,  Bürgin Matthias,  Schwehr Peter,  Zemp Richard,  Lutz Selina"," Juppien Angelika,  Zemp Richard"

The results were published in a joint publication with the Lucerne City Archives. When the master classes were first held in Lucerne in 1943, an institution was created that engaged prominent musicians as lecturers every summer for almost 60 years in cooperation with the Music Festival Weeks (today's Lucerne Festival) and the Conservatory. Piano, violin, violoncello and singing formed the subject foundation, which was only selectively expanded. Edwin Fischer, Wolfgang Schneiderhan, Enrico Mainardi and Franziska Martienssen-Lohmann were the early defining figures. This resulted in loose connections between the master lecturers and local conditions or those that lasted for years. The spectacular location of the conservatory on Dreilinden as a place of instruction played its part. In the summer of 2003, the master classes were transferred to the Festival Academy.

Museums are increasingly discovering social media as a communication channel. The preparation of museum content for communication in social media has not yet been researched and systematized. Audience+ STORY asks how the narrative potential of mediation and curation can be used to process the content of a collection or exhibition in a media-specific manner in social media. The goal is a toolbox that can be used to develop social media content for museums. In the course of the previous Audience+ project, we found that the use of social media in the museum context is currently primarily in the marketing and communication departments and that, accordingly, classic content of museum communication is primarily disseminated via social media. However, it is very questionable whether the duplication of classic unidirectional information via social media will lead to long-term success. The use of social media is particularly successful when it uses the inherent possibilities of dialogue. The observation of successful museum social media projects, especially in foreign museums, leads us to the hypothesis that this works primarily through the narrative preparation of museum content. It is the objects in the museums and their stories that fascinate and touch people emotionally. This rich world of museums needs to be transferred to social media in a media-specific way. Social media platforms must therefore be understood as an extended museum space15. They are therefore not just an appendage of the communication strategy, but part of the overall strategy of the museum. In any case, existing knowledge and materials from curation and mediation and research should be used. Consequently, the Audience+ STORY project is about substantiating and systematizing our hypothesis with the help of case studies and checking it in the specific Swiss museum context with applied case studies."," Kummler Barbara,  Minder Schade Bettina,  Di Valentino Roberto,  Frei Samuel,  Schleiss Sandra,  Mohr Seraina", Vogelsang Axel

Music students engage in more than 10’000 hours of musical practice in their life before being ready to begin a professional career and most of these hours are spent practicing at home or in a practice room or studio box at Conservatoires and music schools. Musical skills and interpretation abilities are forged and refined mostly while practicing in a small room, often with inappropriate acoustics, and in isolation. The discrepancy between this setting and the reality of the concert hall is striking. Acoustics, size, shape, perspective, and presence of the audience: the difference between the two scenarios poses the question to what extent years of practicing in studio boxes or small rooms prepare music students for the real world experience of the concert venue. How do music students cope with this experience? What strategies do they use––if any––to prepare themselves for this change of spatial and social setting? How do they perceive, feel and experience the space around them? This case study project explored these questions through a semi-structured interviews run with four highly trained music students, prior and after a solo concert that marked the launch of their career as professional performers. Results show that this change of context poses three main challenges to young musicians: different acoustics, psychological pressure and the kind of attitude that the concert situation requests. These challenges are experienced as inevitable components of musicians’ life and students are reluctant to admit those difficulties while striving to find strategies to cope with them. Three strategies emerged as beneficial: mental rehearsal, training in a concert-like setting and enhancing flexibility.", Baldassarre Antonio, Alessandri Elena

Musicking (Small 1998) is at the heart of people’s social life and cultural experience (DeNora 2008; Turino 2008). Examining people’s engagement with music and dance as performative acts, thus, is also essential to understanding the ways refugees construct and express their identities and bond with others socially. Since musical practices (including listening, dancing, sharing digital links, etc.) are social activities, they have the potential to support refugees to overcome dislocation, alienation, loneliness, homesickness, void, and despair by enabling the individual to socially reconnect and bond. Accordingly, numerous studies of migrant, minority, and refugee groups have shown that cultural continuity is crucial for the individuals’ social wellbeing (Berry 2005).“Mobile Identities” has examined popular music’s role in the production of meaning for individuals and the shaping of new communities and sociomusical practices as well as the joint effect of media and migration on the work of social imagination as a constitutive feature of modern subjectivity. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the planned interviews with young adult refugees could not be realized.

There is a tension between the conservative musical action, which finds its expression in implicit or explicit norms, and the changing action, which under certain circumstances clearly sets itself apart from conventions. Every sound and every mediation of music can be understood as a poietic positioning in this field. The research and development project uses the example of yodeling and blowing the alphorn to discuss the concepts of ""passing on"" and ""mediation"".

In December 16, the community assembly then decided to continue the community work as a permanent offer. After the positive decision of the Cham municipal assembly (December 2011) to set up a project center for community work, a new area for youth and community work was formed in April 2013 for a project phase of four years. In December 2016, the municipal assembly decided to continue community work in Cham as a permanent offer for the population. Among other things, the evaluation report and the conclusions and recommendations for action drawn therein served as the basis for the decision. The overarching goal of the GWA Cham is to promote the quality of life in the various districts. To this end, community work has developed various offers and projects for the population over the past four years. The evaluation shows that during the build-up phase of community work, the thematic priorities of work with the elderly and migration/integration and neighborhood help emerged, in which community work succeeds well in establishing supporting structures. The community work thus takes into account important social developments in Cham and supplements the existing offers in the community. Some recommendations for action can be derived from the evaluation results. In order to take into account the independent social life in the various quarters, the contacts and the presence of the GWA in the quarters should be strengthened. An important success factor of the GWA is the cooperation with the administrative offices of the municipality of Cham. Internal networking and cooperation must be strengthened and structurally anchored in the future. In the long term, the GWA also needs public recognition of its achievements and the great voluntary commitment. We recommend the expansion and conceptual further development of public relations work with the inclusion of professional support."," Aeschlimann Lea,  Fux Sarah", Bezzola Franco

In addition to averting dangers, there are also opportunities that can now be seized, for example to counteract the climate crisis. What is needed now is a procedure and a concept of how the public sector - here using the example of the canton of Lucerne - can decide and act quickly and effectively. In the empirical part, suggestions from business associations and members of parliament are systematically included and supplemented by further suggestions derived from a SWOT analysis.

After a euphoric first phase, blockchain technology is on the verge of serious implementation in broad areas of application, including beyond the financial sector. Although certain technical hurdles (e.g. scalability, energy efficiency) still have to be overcome, it is evident that the blockchain is a disruptive key technology: The potential for data-based process management and economic transactions of all kinds is enormous, especially in the specific application of smart contracts . Their disruptive moment consists in the possibility, without the need for trustworthy third parties, to carry out action steps previously written into the blockchain automatically and transparently and comprehensibly according to an ""if-then"" logic.

A contribution to practice didactics in instrumental lessons with children up to about ten years of age Children practice in a way specific to them. A precise knowledge of the instrumental teacher about the learning of the individual child enables individual approaches in the lesson and decides on its success. In the field of instrumental and vocal pedagogy, false and outdated ideas about the learning of children are still widespread, so that a reorientation is an urgent concern. In this, the learning field of practicing with children is to be understood as the main topic, since dealing with it affects all other learning fields of instrumental or vocal lessons. This and the need for research are indicated by the complaints from instrumental teachers, music school administrators and parents that have been accumulating for years because of the children's lack of practice discipline. It is probably the children themselves who suffer the most, as they feel the pressure of expectations they cannot meet and look forward to the next lesson with feelings of guilt. The following insights and subsequent instructions for action could be gained from the continuous observation of practicing with children: a) Depending on the developmental maturity and different learning preferences, individually adapted approaches to the individual child prove to be expedient. During training and further education, instrumental teachers must be made more aware of the peculiarities of children's learning behavior than before, and appropriate didactic and methodical tools and skills must be taught with regard to practicing. b) Since playing and practicing together is much more appropriate for children, it is preferable to playing and practicing alone. Elementary schools are also increasingly making time vessels available for joint learning at school and minimizing homework. c) If learning in groups is not possible and therefore only playing and practicing is required, electronic media should increasingly be used. Teachers must support children in dealing with them."," Camp Marc-Antoine,  Degen Stefan,  Petersen Suse", Brand Marc
2176,92064,Conversational Onboarding ,https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/hochschule-luzern/forschung/projekte/detail/?pid=6154,Laufend (Aktiv),2022,2023,CC Financial Services,"Conversational Onboarding The project aims to develop and test the design for a conversational onboarding process for Swiss insurers for products with highly sensitive data, such as life insurance. After digitization has already revolutionized several sectors such as music, tourism and media, it has now also had an increasing influence on the insurance industry over the past six years. So-called InsurTech startups - young companies that pursue technology-driven business models - are springing up like mushrooms: within less than five years, their number has exploded from just a handful to several thousands worldwide. Their goal is to drive innovation at all stages of an insurer's value chain and to improve the customer experience with faster processing times and digital solutions. The US InsurTech startup “Lemonade” is often cited as an example of this development. After its founding in 2015 and strong growth, it has been listed on the stock exchange since July 2020. In contrast to traditional insurers, the company operates entirely digitally. For example, their onboarding process - i.e. the process that customers have to go through to take out an insurance product - is purely digital via conversational interface or with the help of the Lemonade chatbot ""Maya"". However, it should be critically noted that such new onboarding processes based on conversational interfaces initially gave the InsurTechs a wide reach, but do not necessarily have to be reflected in the company's success or in customer satisfaction. This leads to the conclusion that the use of such technologies alone cannot be regarded as a competitive advantage. Rather, the latter can only be realized if the design of the conversational interface is tailored to the respective target group. This applies in particular to comparatively complex insurance products such as life insurance. These require a data-secure identification of the customers and thus an authentication process, which is not yet available in the form of a conversational interface. The planned project aims to develop and test the design for a conversational onboarding process for Swiss insurers for products with highly sensitive data, such as life insurance. Specifically, the two central questions are to be answered: How should a digital onboarding process based on a conversational interface be designed? Which methods are suitable for the reliable identification of insurance customers and how can these be integrated into an initial prototype?"," Schreiber Florian,  Hafner Nils", Hundertmark Sophie

After an initial attempt to transform Mongolia into a decentralized state failed in the 1990s and the country was temporarily recentralized, the task today is to redevelop decentralization combined with deeper democratization. Switzerland was asked by the President of Mongolia to support this development. The SDC is willing to provide this support and has asked the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts for this purpose. The first step was to develop a tailor-made program (Governance and Decentralization Program GDP) based on an in-depth analysis of the Mongolian situation and in cooperation with Mongolian partners from politics and research. The implementation of the GDP decentralization component (Decentralization Policy Support Program DPSP) will then be supported. DPSP is implemented directly by the Cabinet Secretariat, which reports to the Prime Minister, with technical support from HSLU; DPSP is specifically dedicated to the division of tasks and income and the reform of financial equalization.

In order to be able to measure such formations, however, the perceptual conditions of musical simultaneity must first be clarified. After the focus in the project ""Auditive Synchronicity I"" was solely on the perception of tonal simultaneity in certain instrument sounds, the question in the present project was extended to practical aspects of playing. The results of tests with synchronization of instrumental sounds show that the event moment of a sound or its synchronization time is on average around a third of its transient time (duration between physical onset and peak), but for the individual instrument groups of strings, brass and woodwinds is very different. In a comparison between the synchronization results in match practice and those in focused perception, the former show greater scatter, as expected. In addition, there are microtemporally significant, but not necessarily sound-specific, differences between the simultaneity realized through practical playing and the simultaneity produced through focused perception. In both modes of synchronization, the participants individually synchronized the sounds very differently, which means that musical ""simultaneity"" is not acoustically realized uniformly. The data obtained was used to refine the Rhythmic Event Detector implemented in LARA."," Emmenegger Claudia,  Alessandri Elena,  Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Senn Olivier", Camp Marc-Antoine

Sustainability is a central but broad field in the construction and real estate industry. The project focuses on the main drivers of real estate values and sustainable investments: market stability, user interests, location development and the regulatory environment. Technological solutions for renewable energies in the housing market are dealt with in the context of locations, building law options and economic laws. Methodologically, the project uses quantitative analyzes of current and historical market developments, observed tenant preferences from initial letting processes and geo-referenced information on investment and construction activity over the last ten years. The quantitative-empirical analyzes of this project show, for example, that the greatest challenge does not lie in a conflict of goals between ecology and economy. On the contrary: High-demand locations offer high long-term financial potential for investments in densification and sustainable technologies. However, it is precisely at these locations that the use of renewable energies is sometimes limited technically or by building regulations because they are already densely built up or because the old stock offers fewer technological alternatives than the energetically exemplary new buildings on the green field. In addition, the economic potential of post-compaction is often of a theoretical nature. In practice, the density of regulation, building law uncertainties and objections generate risk premiums that are reflected in cost increases. As a result, the actual incentives for investing in complex inner concentrations are often less attractive than the assessment of the situation theoretically promises. The output is practice-oriented recommendations for the measurement, control and communication of sustainable direct real estate investments from an opportunity-risk perspective.

To recognize this, CC Electronics has developed a sensor network that detects earth movements and can trigger an alarm. Natural hazards such as landslides, rockfalls and avalanches, but also dam failures and floods can endanger our habitat. Such dangers are omnipresent, especially in the Alpine region. The population density in the Alpine region does not allow potentially endangered areas to be uninhabited or only to a very limited extent. The early detection of natural hazards, especially to save human lives, is of great importance. In the case of possible landslides and compromised dams, earth movement, slope and soil moisture must be monitored. For this purpose, sensors and measuring devices are installed and wired in boreholes and on the surface of the terrain. This cabling is complex and expensive. With wireless systems, surveillance systems could be set up faster and more cheaply. As part of the EU project GoodFood, the Competence Center Electronics at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has gained experience with wireless sensor nodes. A sensor node is a battery-operated autonomous system that communicates with the neighboring sensor nodes via radio and uses sensors to measure local measurements such as slope gradient and soil moisture. The inexpensive sensor nodes combine to form a self-organizing network. If a node fails, the neighbors take over its function. Since the nodes only have to communicate with their neighbors, they can be equipped with energy-saving transmitters and receivers. With a set of batteries they work for about a year. However, the system developed in GoodFood still lacks the important function of determining earth movement. This is determined by measuring the distance between the sensor nodes and their neighbors. As soon as a distance exceeds a limit, it can be assumed that the ground is moving. This distance measurement was developed in the GeoAlertNet project. The sensor nodes are spread out over the endangered area. At regular intervals, they measure their distance from their neighbors and other parameters such as soil moisture. These are transmitted wirelessly over the network to the main node. As soon as measurement signals exceed limit values, the responsible persons are alerted by radiotelephony. This then decides how to proceed. Such a network is suitable for the continuous monitoring of endangered areas and represents the infrastructure for the early detection of natural hazards. The project was interdisciplinary, geologists, physicists, electrical engineers and computer scientists worked together. The system was developed and tested in cooperation with the geotechnical company Solexperts in Mönchaltdorf. The goal is a successful product that is suitable for everyday use.

In addition to an evaluation of the literature, six choirs from German-speaking Switzerland were examined as case studies. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with the choir directors and individual members of these six choirs. Theses were derived from the empirical data and the literature evaluation, which were discussed and further developed in a workshop with experts from the choral world. The results show that choral life is very dynamic and diverse. In addition to numerous choir dissolutions, many new, often short-lived ensembles are founded, and there is a large fluctuation of members within choirs. There is a clear trend towards carrying out temporary choir projects and establishing project choirs. These developments are related to the decreasing willingness and possibility of the singers to commit themselves to participate in a choir for a longer period of time. While the number of female choirs is growing, that of male choirs is declining. Male voices are also underrepresented in many mixed choirs. The choral forms and the repertoire of the choirs are becoming more diverse overall, which is due, among other things, to the increasing diversity within the population and to globalization and individualization. Compared to the past, musical content is more important for participation in a choir. Overall, an increase in quality and professionalization can be observed on both an artistic and an organizational level, which is sometimes connected to today's performance orientation in society and the influence of electronic media. The choral system reacts to the demographic change on the one hand with intergenerational and intercultural projects, on the other hand with offers for certain target groups such as older people, young people or people with a migration background. There are various areas of tension in connection with demographic and social change, which are addressed in this report. This includes, in particular, questions of the inclusion and exclusion of singers due to the specific objectives of a choir. If the choral system remains changeable, faces the social challenges and recognizes the resulting opportunities, many people will continue to sing together in the future and thus continue a tradition that is extremely lively today."," Kull Annatina,  Stäheli Reto,  Petersen Suse", Camp Marc-Antoine

Net zero means that CO2 may still be emitted from 2050, but at the same time CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere to the same extent by natural and technical storage. Almost all of NET's major and much-cited studies and reviews list biomass production by plants on land and algae in the oceans, but overlook algae production in bioreactors. There is no way to produce biomass as energy- and volume-efficiently as by producing microalgae in warm water, whose growth rates are up to 50 times faster than fast-growing plants on land. The biomass, consisting of the elements C, H, O, N, P and S, binds an average of 1.66 kg CO2 per kg microalgae. According to the literature, it is expected that an area-related production rate of 287 t/ha/a biomass can already be achieved with photobioreactors without artificial light sources; up to 155 t/ha/a are already being achieved today. If artificial light is used in addition to natural light, this productivity can be increased many times over. The CC TEVT project team around Prof. Dr. Mirko Kleingries has been investigating the process of microalgae cultivation in photobioreactors for a year and a half now. The method was theoretically evaluated and numerous practical investigations were carried out. As part of this project, ten small laboratory reactors (12 liters each) are being used to investigate the growth of algae in long-term tests under various operating conditions. This made it possible to gain insights into the production rates and the nutrients required for this. Furthermore, it was and is being determined how later highly scaled algae plants are to be set up from a geometric and process-specific point of view."," Widmer Dominik,  Fill Marc,  Tamburini Reto", Kleingries Mirko

Can mechanosensitive ion channels play an important role in the dedifferentiation process? Disuse or prolonged mechanical unloading of cartilage leads to accelerated degeneration. This can be observed in particular in bedridden patients and astronauts during their stay in space. Because cartilage has very limited self-healing capacity, repair of damaged or degenerated cartilage remains a challenging clinical problem. Cell-based approaches to expand tissues in vitro are severely limited since chondrocytes (cartilage cells) usually dedifferentiate in culture (particularly in 2D culture). In doing so, they lose the ability to produce high-quality cartilage. Because cartilage and chondrocytes are highly mechanosensitive, several experiments were performed under real and simulated microgravity conditions to study the response to a mechanically unstressed environment. The intervertebral discs of rats that have flown in space showed clear signs of disc degeneration: wet and dry weights were reduced and the collagen to proteoglycan ratio was increased. Similar effects have been observed under simulated microgravity by clinostatic rotation. An experiment with chondrocytes, carried out under real weightlessness on board the International Space Station and under simulated weightlessness on the Random Positioning Machine (RPM), showed reduced proteoglycan deposition and reduced cell density. However, collagen I/II gene expression ratios were lower in the ISS and RPM samples compared to the static control. Decreased collagen I/II ratio was later confirmed in two experiments under simulated weightlessness on the RPM. These data suggest that mechanically generated unloading, either from real or simulated weightlessness, amplifies signs of degeneration. At the same time, however, the dedifferentiation process is delayed. The conversion of a mechanical force into an intracellular signal has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, it is still not clear which mechanisms are responsible for the response of cartilage and cartilage cells, either in real or simulated weightlessness. Some transient receptor potential channels are known for their mechanosensitivity and are therefore of central interest. Studies have shown that chondrocyte dedifferentiation in 2D culture results in altered gene expression of several members of the TRP family. While the function of most TRP channels in chondrocytes remains unknown, TRPV4 plays an important role in volume regulation of chondrocytes exposed to osmotic pressure. The aim of this project is to investigate whether the RPM can be used to modulate the dedifferentiation process of chondrocytes and whether transient receptor potential ion channels play an important role in this process."," Egli Marcel,  Provini Markus,  Mosimann Matthias,  Gilgien Pascal", Wüest Simon

The project took up the issue and better connected second home owners with the communities, tourism organizations and local service providers. Only a sixth of the approximately 900 second homes and holiday apartments on the right shore of Lake Thun were offered for rent to third parties. For this reason, the project management set itself the goal of making better use of the existing second and holiday homes, increasing the number of apartments available for rent, increasing regional value creation and strengthening the relationships between second home owners, tourism organizations and communities. To this end, various measures were developed and implemented: An information platform (zweitwohnung-thunersee.ch) was set up as a central contact point for concerns and information for those who own a second home. This has prepared content on topics such as rental or tourist taxes. In order to reduce the cost of renting, services were designed that either provide partial support or take over the entire care of guests and apartments. The Services are provided by a local provider. In order to be able to better market the offer on the Internet and on booking platforms, professional pictures were taken of numerous apartments. This was subject to conditions, such as the obligation to rent the apartment for at least three years. In addition, a renovation subsidy for second homes was installed based on the model of an initiative in another destination in the Bernese Oberland. With regard to communication and maintaining relationships with the owners of second homes, the information platform and the direct address were used above all. In the summer of 2020, the owners were invited to aperitifs to provide direct and informal information and exchange ideas. Communication was given special attention in the further course. A video with recordings from the region was used to motivate owners to rent and visit more often. The quantitative goals of the project were measured, but due to the effects of the corona pandemic, the results can only be compared with previous years with great reservations.

At the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are the 17 global goals for sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals, SDG) with 169 sub-goals. They are to be achieved globally and by all UN member states by 2030. Due to the proximity to the population, local economy and civil society organizations, municipalities and cities play an important role at the local level and there is great potential here that has not yet been exhausted. The question of how negotiation and learning processes can be launched and successfully designed at local level for the implementation of the SDG goals and what the contribution and role of sociocultural animation can be are relevant for the development of new professional fields for sociocultural animators and influence not only future research and development projects but also the content of teaching in the main study of sociocultural studies. Through an interpretation of normative (professional) bases, possible potentials for the professional field are worked out and a first prototype for the definition of the role and competencies of sociocultural animation in the implementation of the SDG at the municipal level. This prototype will be further developed in a reflective process with specialists from practice and those responsible for teaching socio-cultural issues."," Schmuziger Alina,  Durrer Eggerschwiler Beatrice,  Näther Caroline", Friz Annina

Offerte_BAFU_Forschungsauftrag_HSLU W The Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) would like to close existing gaps in knowledge regarding communication and behavioral change in the environmental sector. Within the framework of sub-projects, various questions are to be dealt with scientifically. The focus is on communication and marketing approaches to initiate a change in behavior in the direction of ""more environmentally friendly behavior"", whereby knowledge about environmental issues should also be communicated effectively. The present project focuses on the relevant target groups, segmentation along their environmental literacy and the understandable processing of information for these target groups. Final report_BAFU_Summary For the FOEN, there are two central results for the communication of environmental topics: Firstly, the population can be divided into four different target groups (knowing active/passive and ignorant active/passive) on the basis of the central factors from environmental literacy (knowledge and environmental behavior). ). Secondly, the information strategy is particularly effective for all target groups. The communication strategies with positive emotionalization and moral appeal (both classified as effective in the expert interviews) are less effective: knowing active: information strategy knowing passive: information strategy / product benefit ignorant active: information strategy; positive emotionalization avoid ignorant passives: product benefit / information strategy; Avoid moral appeals Passive people respond particularly well to communication that shows them the personal benefit of environmentally friendly behavior. “In the know” are people who already have a great deal of prior knowledge of the environment, while “ignorant” people have a low level of knowledge. ""Active"" people already do a lot for the environment, while ""passive"" people do not (yet) have a pronounced environmental protection behavior. In principle, individuals with a high previous environmental behavior (“active”) can be influenced more easily than those with a low previous environmental behavior (“passive”)."," Briw André,  Schaffner Dorothea,  Federspiel Esther,  Simon Monika,  Hemmi Berwert Muriel,  Breitenmoser Ria", Demarmels Sascha

Office buildings are subject to great pressure to adapt. The work done in corporate offices today is shifting away from focused individual work towards collaboration and teamwork. So far, the strategy to counter this pressure to adapt has been to increase the attractiveness of the corporate office with informal room settings (e.g. spacious tea kitchens, sofa corner). Too little attention was paid to the design of formal spaces, i.e. spaces for a planned collaboration. If it is not possible to adapt the company's own office structures in such a way that the attractiveness of the corporate office is maintained even with changed working methods and working models, there is a risk that employees will lose identification with the company and that the office space will be underutilized. The CTI project Corporate Collaboration Spaces is investigating how formal meeting and collaboration spaces can meet the needs of today's knowledge workers. The focus is on a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that includes space, furnishings, integration of ICT and comfort as well as the corresponding methods, processes and organizational framework. In addition, the room settings are checked with regard to their flexibility and variability and it is shown to what extent the adaptability of the work settings supports the work processes of the teams.

Recommendations for action for builders and planners Climate change will lead to a marked increase in temperature by the end of the century. The project examines the effects on the building stock (energy and comfort) and formulates recommendations for the planning of climate change-friendly buildings. Without a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, an increase in the seasonal mean temperature of 3.2 - 4.8 °C by the end of the 21st century can be expected. This change will have a massive impact on the energy requirements (cooling) and comfort of buildings. A central role is ascribed to the building design. With a 46% share of Swiss energy consumption, the building stock plays a key role. The ""ClimaBau"" study by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has shown which points must be considered during planning if residential buildings are to be efficient and sustainable for decades to come. Protecting buildings from overheating plays a key role. If there is no response today, the buildings planned today will no longer meet the demands of the future. Among other things, energy consumption in the summer months could increase many times over due to the spread of cooling devices. On the one hand, the study is intended to examine how housing developers and builders deal with the issue of climate change in the current planning of residential buildings. Which measures and strategies are known and are they being implemented? What are the obstacles that prevent measures from being implemented? By means of surveys of representative decision-makers, a position determination on the current challenges is to be carried out. On the other hand, the project is intended to support architects and planners in the design of climate-friendly buildings. In order to guarantee energetically optimal operation over the entire life cycle of residential buildings, future-oriented planning must be carried out today. The focus here is on the parameters that can be influenced in the early design phase and finding a balance between the three subject areas: solar gains, overheating problems and use of daylight. The ""ClimaBau"" study primarily identified the proportion of windows and the storage capacity of buildings with regard to comfort and air conditioning requirements. These findings are now to be continued and the conscious use of window surfaces and the targeted use of architectural elements are to be promoted. With the inclusion of the new standard SN/EN 17037 ""Daylight in buildings"", the quality and sustainability of new construction projects should be increased in the long term."," Schrader Björn,  Manz Heinrich,  Stampfli Janine,  Schwarz Jürg,  King Marvin,  Huonder Michael,  Häfliger Reto,  Marek Reto,  Domingo Irigoyen Silvia,  Büttner Sina,  Menti Urs-Peter"," Settembrini Gianrico,  Stampfli Janine"

One of the most intriguing findings of the Research Project “Music Related Visual Sources of Switzerland from the Middle Ages to 1650” (project lead: Prof Dr Antonio Baldassarre) conducted at the School of Music of Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts was the discovery of two quite similar early sixteenth-century canvases, one in the collection of the Musikmuseum - Historisches Museum Basel, the other in a private collection, located in Herrliberg, Zurich. Both provide an exuberant visual depiction of the Castalian Spring including a vast amount of Hellenic andcontemporary musical motifs and hence present a unique allegory of music. Neither the canvases themselves nor their topical interrelationship and their cultural and socio historical contexts have been subject to comprehensive and comparative scholarship. The recent and painstaking restoration of the Basel painting that also resulted in new insights, and the willingness of the owner of the Herrliberg canvas to grant access to his painting, provide a unique opportunity to fill the mentioned research gap with a symposium in which experts of various research fields will gather to present their ideas and thoughts on the visual agendas and pictorial narratives as well as on the interrelationships and the cultural and socio-historical contexts of thetwo paintings.

It refers to those musical qualities, which make people engage emotionally with the music, move their bodies to the rhythm, and participate in a shared musical experience. Past research proposed a couple of explanations for the groove phenomenon. Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil (1987) hypothesized that timing asynchronies on a millisecond level, and small discrepancies in dynamics, pitch or timbre (= Participatory Discrepancies or PDs) are responsible for causing the groove. Laurence Zbikowski (2004) on the other hand described repetitive, multi-layered patterns on a macro level (multi-bar units) as relevant for creating groove. Mark Doffman (2008) integrated Keil’s and Zbikowski’s approaches by considering both PD patterns and macro-structures in his analysis of three jazz performances. In a recent empirical study, Matthew Butterfield (2010) challenged Keil’s claim that temporal PDs are relevant for the generation of groove. Butterfield tested for the salience of temporal PDs in perception. Since the participants of his study barely recognized PDs above chance level, he concluded that PDs are of minor relevance for producing groove. The design of Butterfield’s study, however, raises some concern: he tested the cognitive time discrimination skills of the participants; he did not measure the impact of PDs on the emotions and body motion behaviour of participants. Hence, Butterfield’s dismissal of the PDs as irrelevant for the groove experience appears to be premature. The proposed project aims to clarify how temporal PDs influence the experience of groove in listeners of recorded jazz and funk examples. The empirical data will be collected in the course of two listening tests with 80 participants each. The stimuli will be derived from expert duo (bass and drums) performances by extensive audio editing. The emotional impact of the stimuli will be measured with the SAM (Self-Assessment-Manikin) method and with a newly developed method, called EAG (Emotional Assessment of Grooviness). The influence of the stimuli on the physical behaviour of the participants (such as finger or foot tapping or head bobbing) will be measured with video-based motion capture technology and surface electromyography (EMG). The project pools the competences of the Music Performance Study Group at Hochschule Luzern (music performance, audio recording, audio editing and analysis) and of the Institute for Musicology and Music Pedagogy at Giessen University (empirical methods in music psychology and medical science, statistical analysis)."," Alessandri Elena,  Kressebuch Leandro,  Kilchenmann Lorenz,  Vonesch Marcel,  Sandmeier Nicole,  Christof Peter,  Zwiauer Wolfgang", Senn Olivier

People Analytics is part of a more general shift in management relying on data. It is focusing on the real-time acquisition, analysis, and prediction of employee performance and engagement, work and collaboration patterns. The fundamental assumption is that human experience and intuition in organizational decision-making should, to a substantial degree, be replaced by data leading to an ’evidence-based’ form of human resource management and a data-driven culture. By collecting and connecting a great variety of data, People Analytics is designed to establish new ways to predict, evaluate, and control individual and organizational behavior, leading to new visibilities and algorithmically imposed hierarchies at the workplace. The high relevance of People Analytics for the future of work stands in stark contrast to a lacking empirical knowledge about the practices and effects of algorithm-based decision-making systems. The project analyzes the application and the implementation dynamics of People Analytics and its effects on employees’ self-management, managerial decision-making, and employment relations. With a systematic cross-case comparison of pioneering companies from Germany and Switzerland, it analyzes how a new regime of control based on data, calculation, and Artificial Intelligence is being negotiated organizationally. On the case study level, it aims to reveal the micro-foundations of People Analytics. In the comparative perspective, the influence of external software suppliers as well as company-specific data culture and data governance (including the role of national labor and data protection laws) on the implementation process are analyzed, thereby revealing specific data cultures governing economic life.

This is shown by a study on sports facility statistics in Switzerland. Political bodies and administrations of the Confederation, cantons and municipalities depend on reliable statistics of the sports facilities, for example in order to formulate a needs-based sports facilities policy or as a starting point for the interpretation of the movement behavior of the population. Against this background, the Federal Office for Sport FOSPO and individual cantons, among others, financed the research project ""Sports Facility Statistics 2012"". The aim of the statistics is to record all sports facilities and their parts that allow for minimal regular public use. The sports facility statistics for 2012 show around 32,000 sports facilities or parts of sports facilities. These are mostly open-air facilities such as soccer fields or playgrounds (37%). Gymnasiums and sports halls are found just as often (21%). Seven out of 100 facility parts belong to pools (e.g. swimming pools or diving boards), while only 1 percent of all recorded facility parts relate to ice sports.

The district observation brings synergy effects through networking, be it through the use of waste heat, through combined solutions with CHP and photovoltaics. Positive annual energy balances in individual buildings are often touted today as a solution to the energy problem. According to current knowledge, such ""plus energy balances"" for large buildings cannot be achieved due to the desired densities in today's settlements, their multi-storey structure and mutual facade shading by neighboring buildings, and due to the potentially high network load (externalization of temporary energy storage), they are also not desirable. In Plusqua, the energy balance limit is extended from the building to the quarter. Viewing the neighborhood allows you to break out of the typology of individual buildings. The district analysis can bring about synergy effects through networking, be it through the use of waste heat for heating purposes, through combined solutions that result in sufficient base load for CHP, or other forms of networking, be it thermal or electrical. Through a clever combination of uses (residential, administrative, commercial, retail, etc.), through densification and other measures, it is possible to use the PV peak of larger solar systems in the district itself, eg in the service sector. Thanks to the network, it will also be conceivable in the future that excess energy, especially electrical energy, will not only be dissipated via the power grid. The networking of residential areas with other uses can bring a clear advantage here compared to individual buildings. Possible and sensible measures for individual buildings should be identified from the quarter observation."," Stettler Christoph,  Hangartner Diego,  Settembrini Gianrico,  Plüss Iwan,  Brücker Stefan", Menti Urs-Peter

Against the background of the under-representation of women in influential positions in profit-oriented companies, non-profit as well as in public organizations (hereinafter summarized under organizations), it is important to improve the visibility of women, especially in the context of their communication. A large number of socio-psychological and psycholinguistic studies show that by dispensing with gender-sensitive language (e.g. “shareholders” or “customers”), the mental involvement and representation of women is reduced and the decision-making behavior of women and men changes accordingly. Despite these insights into the importance of gender-sensitive language, there is a lack of implementation in the communication of companies and public organizations. On the basis of the above findings, guidelines for gender-sensitive language have been developed in most public institutions and in many larger companies.

However, it is unclear to what extent these tasks and their performance can be condensed into consistent roles of compliance officers. Role models are used to simplify complex constructs such as extensive bundles of tasks through the use of metaphors, the positioning and delimitation of a position within an organization and the orientation of the position holder. The identification and consolidation of task bundles into consistent roles of compliance officers would thus support their positioning within their organization, reduce unclear expectations of the compliance officer themselves and other organization members and thereby reduce role conflicts and also enable role-based training and further education of compliance officers . It is important that the external image and the self-image of the roles match as far as possible. The aim of the project should therefore be the identification of task and competence profiles as well as role models of the compliance office. Specifically, the following research questions are to be examined: What requirements does a compliance officer have to meet? What tasks do compliance officers take on in corporate practice? To what extent can role models of compliance officers be derived from the tasks and their performance? Is there a difference between the external image and the self-image of compliance officers? To what extent are compliance officers satisfied with their roles? What implications can be derived from the results for corporate practice, CM research and the training of compliance officers at universities? On the one hand, the identification of consistent role models is important for deriving the necessary competence profiles and thus for the training and recruitment of compliance officers. On the other hand, role models serve to make the company's expectations of the position of the compliance officer transparent and thus to avoid role conflicts due to conflicting expectations of the compliance officer themselves and other members of the organization."," Unruh Anjuli,  Würzburg Antje,  Grau Susanne"," Henrizi Philipp,  Grau Susanne"

In the project, the perception and coping with this are examined by superiors and HR managers. Representative population studies on the prevalence of mental disorders show that about one in three adults will develop a mental disorder requiring treatment at some point in their lives (Jacobi et al., 2004). The number of early invalidations due to increased diagnosed mental disorders and stress has increased significantly in recent years (OECD, 2014). For companies and their managers, the mental health and performance of their employees is a decisive productivity factor. You must ensure that work does not make you ill - neither physically nor mentally. This is in the economic interest of the company, because employees who feel good and mentally stable are efficient and productive. However, due to the high prevalence of mental disorders in the population, companies and their managers are inevitably confronted with mentally impaired employees time and again. So far, there has been a lack of in-depth knowledge of how to perceive and deal with the problem, as well as practical instructions and assistance derived from this to support those responsible in companies. Supervisors and HR managers have a special responsibility: Their management mandate includes, among other things, the perception and observation of potential, changes and irregularities in employees (cf. Wunderer, 2003). Since many prejudices still prevail when it comes to mental illness, the risk of stigmatization is high. A first pilot study on the subjective assessment of problem situations in the workplace by managers showed that psychological problems of employees in companies and the resulting problem situations are a mass phenomenon and urgently need to be investigated in more depth and across the board (Baer et al., 2011). Many of those surveyed perceived mentally impaired employees as ""difficult"" (""character problems"") and tried to improve the situation by appealing to employees' sense of duty and motivation to perform. The team members reacted most frequently with impatience, annoyance and a lack of understanding to mentally conspicuous behavior on the part of their colleagues. In most cases (90%) the solution to the problem on the part of the manager was termination of the employment relationship. The results of the pilot study are now to be replicated, expanded and deepened with regard to their generalizability. Based on the empirical knowledge of the perspectives and behavior of those involved and their need for action, practical options for action are finally developed, which also take into account the dynamics of cooperation between managers, employees, doctors, other bodies (IV etc.) in the case of mental problems at the workplace."," Schaufelberger Daniel,  Regli Flavia,  Steinmann Flavia,  Gentile Gian-Claudio,  Langenegger Lara,  Auerbach Sarah,  Kyburz Stefanie", Basler Monica

However, the lack of internal data makes this difficult. The project intends to make robust pricing easy and ubiquitous. RoomPriceGenie is a SaaS company that provides dynamic pricing for smaller hotels. Up to now, it has been a major challenge to calculate such adequately, which is one of the reasons why RoomPriceGenie is currently the only provider in this area. In addition, the number of data points provided by smaller hotels is far fewer than larger hotels, and the mindset of small hotel managers tends to be less quantitative than that of revenue managers at large hotels. The solution that RoomPriceGenie offers must therefore be a) easy to use, b) intuitive, c) accurate and d) cheap. These limitations can further complicate the already challenging issue of dynamic pricing. RoomPriceGenie would like to use this Innosuisse project to develop price solutions that meet these restrictions or criteria for all hotels. The project will use a different data source than the current pricing model, namely the reservation data. By combining different data sources in a robust and complete algorithmic framework, RoomPriceGenie has a complete and easily scalable solution that allows the company to grow far faster. In addition, the project also provides forecasts and diagnostic indicators that complement the user experience and further increase sales and confidence in the system."," Pfäffli Daniel,  Gröger Fabian,  Bär Florian,  Wullschleger Pascal,  Kakooee Reza"," Mazumder Sita,  Pfäffli Daniel"

Measured by the share of the total number of Swiss pension funds, collective and community institutions (SGE) are the segment that has grown the most in recent years. This shift has particularly come at the expense of small (captive) pension funds, which can no longer operate efficiently due to a lack of economies of scale and synergies. Measured by the proportion of all actively insured persons in Switzerland, collective and community institutions are already by far the largest provider segment at around 72%. The rapidly advancing digital transformation and the associated availability of new technologies also poses major challenges for pension institutions. In addition to these upheavals, however, the institutions are also facing numerous other challenges, such as an increasing longevity risk, increasing strain on solidarity between young and old, potentially unfavorable capital market developments, etc. The effects of these are not identical for all institutions and sometimes depend heavily on the individual structure of the business and other specific characteristics. For example, it could be assumed that there are significant differences in orientation between the smaller and larger industry representatives, which are reflected accordingly in business success. At this point, however, it is sobering to note that all studies currently available on the market comparing pension funds - such as the Swisscanto pension fund study or the pension fund comparison by Weibel, Hess & Partner in cooperation with Finanz und Wirtschaft and the SonntagsZeitung - consider collective and community institutions as consider a unified segment. However, it should be noted that, in addition to certain similarities, there are significant differences between the two forms of administration, which can also be felt in the market positioning, among other things. Our scientific study closes this gap and provides answers to numerous other relevant questions. By positioning ourselves as the central source of scientific information for collective and joint institutions, we are making a fundamental contribution to sharpening understanding of one of the most important pillars of the Swiss pension landscape."," Perpignano Ersilia Adele,  Döhnert Karsten,  Hundertmark Sophie,  Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne", Schreiber Florian

At the same time, 15 qualitative interviews were conducted on individual text excerpts to find out how certain texts actually work. In the interviews, we examined the influence of comprehensibility on credibility. It has been shown that easily understandable texts tend to be more credible than incomprehensible texts. However, even incomprehensible texts do not have to have a negative effect on credibility: they do not do this if the readers are aware that they do not belong to the target group. In this case, an incomprehensible text can also inspire awe or convey a sense of competence on the part of the sender. On the other hand, incomprehensible texts can cause frustration if the reader actually wants to understand or if the type of text arouses the expectation that the text is addressed to laypeople and that they can understand it. In any case, as our investigation has clearly shown, incomprehensible texts lead to the reading being stopped. In addition to comprehensibility, other internal text factors influence credibility: the more information a text offers, the more people are willing to trust it. Industry-appropriate imagery and the impression that you are in contact with the sender and know who it is also ensure credibility. The last point can be linked to another result of our survey, namely that personal contact with a bank is the most important guarantee of its credibility."," Janoschka Anja,  Schaffner Dorothea,  Kolberg Sonja,  Krummenacher Sophie,  Compondu Séverine,  Fries Tobias", Demarmels Sascha

But how common are these models really, and how are they distributed historically or stylistically? Even a quick listen can confirm the tendency of pop and rock music towards formulaic harmonies - nevertheless little is known about what exactly the repertoire of the models used is, how often a certain model is actually used or how a model is tied to styles or historical phases is. This project aims to identify the harmonic models used in pop music based on a music corpus of around 1500 songs using machine learning. The repertoire is based on an existing collection of 1,000 recordings put together by 92 specialist journalists. One song is selected from each album. By adding additional data sources with information on the worldwide chart positions and on comparable musicians, the corpus is expanded to a selection of around 1500 songs. Harmonic transcriptions of the sound recordings are created by two professional musicians using automated chord recognition by independently checking the automatic transcriptions and cleaning up discrepancies. In addition to a descriptive statistical evaluation, the resulting data set is examined for recurring sequences using a machine learning algorithm. This automated analysis is intended to enable a new perspective on the harmonics of pop music, in that harmonic facts are not classified under the prerequisites of current harmonic theory. The study will provide a solid overview of the harmonic formulas that actually prevail in pop music and enable precise statements to be made about the frequency, historical and genre-typical location of the harmonic models. It offers starting points for further corpus-based pop music research and is of great interest to a broader audience for music education purposes."," Hoesl Florian,  Senn Olivier,  Jerjen Rafael,  Bechtold Toni Amadeus", Kilchenmann Lorenz

Weightlessness unbalances the physiology and behavior of microorganisms and cells, which can lead to specific reactions that bring us new insights for research on Earth. In future space experiments (2017-2018), cell samples will be taken on the International Space Station ISS as part of the general shock responses and cell flocculation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which will be studied in microgravity. S. cerevisiae (also known as yeast) are excellent for studying a living organism in zero gravity. With the help of yeast, it has already been possible to gain some important insights into the fight against cancer, infections and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Yeast cells are also excellently suited as biotechnological tools and can thus be used in a later space colony, for example, to obtain food. Our group has been working on designing bioreactors for yeast cells in space since 1991. In 1994, yeast cells could be transported into weightlessness for the first time on the STS-65 (Walther et al., 1994). The continuation of these experiments was lost in the tragic Columbia accident, but work continues as part of the YEAST BIOREACTOR project. In this project, different S.cerevisiae strains are used to study the effects of microgravity on decoupled and interacting (flocculation) yeast growth, as well as on stress-induced responses from the application of heat and osmotic shock in microgravity. A uniform experimental procedure should assess the relevant effects of weightlessness. One difficulty in conducting experiments on the ISS is the need to develop specific hardware. In this experiment, cell cultivation will take place in a specially designed constant bioreactor. Overall, the project will play a pioneering role in the field of weightlessness research. It offers the unique opportunity to combine yeast research in microgravity with the help of complex biological and technical analysis options and will thus provide new and important insights for life in microgravity."," Cometto Edgardo,  Ille Fabian,  Wyss Fabienne,  Egli Marcel,  Richard Stéphane,  Wernas Timon", Kauss Dominika

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, wearing a surgical mask (Type II R) has been mandatory for all employees and visitors in hospitals. The masks consist of three layers of synthetic fleece made from the non-renewable resource of petroleum. After a single use, they are disposed of and incinerated. The pandemic has shown that we in Switzerland are dependent on functioning transnational supply chains for the procurement of protective material in order to meet the increased demand. The multiple use of protective material and the resulting mountains of waste are the reason for this research project, which focuses on circular design processes. The goal is to produce the materials for protective clothing from cellulosic material (paper and fleece) and to transfer them to the established paper recycling in a circular process and to use them as the starting material for new paper. Concepts for local, circular processes for the production, use and recycling of protective masks/disposable clothing are to be developed in order to establish the supply in an ecological, agile and transparent manner. The protective masks are optimized in a user-centered manner in terms of design, textile and hygienic properties in order to make use as practical and safe as possible. Since the design of protective masks is being fundamentally revised, standard design practices are currently being questioned and existing process chains analyzed. In addition to the circular development of the protective material, a design-historical analysis is carried out. The use of the protective mask is recapitulated and it is evaluated whether problem definitions and usage practices, for which the protective mask was first designed in the 19th century, can be partially transferred to the research project."," Weber-Hansen Andrea,  Willi Benjamin,  Egloff Brigitte,  Schöb Florence,  Cerretti Geraldine,  Wadsworth Jennifer Louise,  Hügli Joel,  Leysieffer Jonas,  Egli Marcel,  Häusermann Martina,  Wagner Nora Dominique", Moor Christina

The new financial equalization instruments of the NFA have been in force since 2008. Since then, both cantonal governments and parliament have pointed out that there are misguided economic incentives in the new equalization of resources. These consist in the fact that the cantons have little interest in increasing their resource potential, for example through an attractive location policy. The reason given for this is that the difference between additional tax revenue and the loss from fiscal equalization (depending on resource strength, higher expenditure or lower income) is often negative. However, simulations show that this effect depends very much on the level of the tax burden, ie on the tax exhaustion of the resource potential, and on the value of the resource index of the cantons. However, there are only a few systematic studies. It is also unclear how the reform of fiscal equalization as part of Corporate Tax Reform III will affect the incentive effects. The proposed research project is about developing and testing a simulation model that estimates the net effects of a change in resource potential under different conditions.

Since the groundbreaking work of J. Schmidhuber, a new field of research has developed in the field of visual object classification under the keyword ""Deep Learning"" and meanwhile a real hype has developed. The main reason for the hype is the work of IT companies in the overarching field of artificial intelligence (AI), such as Google's Go program ""AlphaGo"", which last year beat one of the world's best professional players. But these technologies are now also ready for use in industry and the CC ISN is noticing an increasing interest in deep learning methods from current (and potential) research partners. However, deep learning methods require very high-performance hardware resources for implementation. The so-called convolutional neural networks (CNN), which form the basis of deep learning methods and represent a further development of the classic neural networks to a large number of ""hidden"" neuron layers, must be used for practical real-time applications on specific hardware platforms (GPUs or for low-power Applications especially FPGAs) are implemented. Therefore, a comprehensive offer in the field of deep learning must almost inevitably offer a suitable hardware platform in addition to the competencies in the field of algorithms and their implementation in a software implementation. In addition, in recent years in the CC ISN, both in the field of communication and in the field of vision, various projects have shown that the possibility of simultaneous and optimally coordinated hardware and software development (so-called co-design) is particularly important represents a specific USP.

As a result, the Kandertal, and in particular the regional center of Frutigen, lacks the most important connection to long-distance traffic. Since the Lötschberg base tunnel went into operation, most IC trains have been running non-stop between Spiez and Visp. As a result, the Kandertal, and in particular the regional center of Frutigen, lacks the most important connection to long-distance traffic. The question therefore arises as to whether the demand potential in the Kandertal is large enough to justify a connection to long-distance traffic with an IC stop in Frutigen in addition to the hourly connection with the Lötschberger. In particular, it was necessary to examine how the utilization of IC and Lötschberger behaves if such a concentration of the offer is made. The reintroduction of an IC stop in Frutigen would mean a significant improvement in the public transport connection for the Frutigen/Adelboden region without the connection to other places in the Kandertal such as Reichenbach or Kandersteg would be impaired in the short term. In connection with the hourly service of the RE-Lötschberger, demand could be increased by around 15%. In addition to the increase in demand, the introduction of an IC stop would also have other consequences for the public transport offer in the Kandertal: increasing compensation needs for the Lötschberger, since a majority of passengers from the Frutigen/Adelboden region switch to the IC and thus the utilization of this offer decreases . In the medium term, there is a risk that the Lötschberger will no longer meet the canton's target requirements for classification at level 2. In combination with the IC stop for the Frutigen/Adelboden region, this would not be a problem. However, a gradation would significantly worsen the public transport offer for Kandersteg and Reichenbach. Without the introduction of the IC stop and with the improvements introduced at the Lötschberger from December 2011, the entire Kandertal can benefit from an improved public transport offer. The supply-induced demand growth in the Frutigen/Adelboden region is lower without an IC stop and is around 5% to 7% in this case."," Schad Helmut,  Diggelmann Thomas", Lutzenberger Martin

Freight transport has been growing at about the same rate as the economy for around 40 years. The volume of goods transported by road is around 18 times higher today than it was in the 1950s, and 4 times more goods are transported by rail than 60 years ago. The transport volume (in tonnes) and the transport performance (in tonne-kilometres) in road and rail freight transport are constantly increasing in Switzerland. The increasing passenger and freight traffic means that the traffic infrastructures are reaching their limits. In addition, traffic has other negative effects on the environment, such as noise, accidents and traffic-related CO2 emissions. In the long term, average economic growth of around 1.5% per year is expected. Assuming that traffic would grow at the same rate, the traffic infrastructure would have to be doubled over the next 40 to 50 years. On a general level, there are essentially three approaches to reducing or avoiding the foreseeable traffic problems: Preventing economic growth in order to stop traffic growth Expanding the traffic infrastructure Decoupling economic growth from traffic growth While the first approach is hardly able to win a majority in our society from today’s perspective, there is also the second approach due to the lack of resources (capital, land) clearly to its limits. For this reason, the decoupling between economic development and the increase in transport performance is of central importance for future development opportunities in Switzerland. Against this background, a project team consisting of national and international experts from the private sector, universities and civil society founded the innovation center for transport-efficient management in Altdorf in the canton of Uri in spring 2015. The idea is based on the preparatory work of seecon gmbh and the Alpen-Initiative as well as on a kick-off workshop in autumn 2013 in Altdorf. The Innovation Center is a politically independent institution with the aim of promoting the decoupling of economic and freight traffic growth. Decoupling means that the transport performance (in tonne-kilometres) of freight transport grows less rapidly than the gross domestic product."," Hauser Christoph,  Schad Helmut,  Gallati Justus,  Mahrer Matthias,  Sonderegger Roger"," von Arx Widar,  Hauser Christoph,  Gallati Justus"

Since its beginnings, the Schaffhausen Jazz Festival has presented improvised music with a close connection to Switzerland. This festival is unique as a showcase for Swiss jazz: the festival program features the big names of the Swiss improvisation scene. On the other hand, young musicians can present themselves on the worsted stage every year. The audio and video recordings of the concerts, recorded live by Swiss radio and television, as well as the recordings submitted by the bands to the festival program committee, represent a collection of audio-visual documents of inestimable value. They document jazz and improvised music in of Switzerland since the early 1990s on a scale, depth and completeness that cannot be found anywhere else. The directors of the Schaffhausen Jazz Festival donated their archive (sound recordings, programmes, posters, etc.) to the Music Library of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and to the Swiss National Sound Archives.

From its inception, film has explored the decoupling of forces from space. There is an analogy with those global phenomena that produce a seemingly universal, dizzying sense of bottomlessness, such as migration, climate change, digitization, neoliberal techniques of control, or the individualized self. Content and goals of the research project For many people, the question of how to deal with the literal and figurative loss of ground is existentially relevant. As a global and seemingly universal phenomenon, it offers opportunities for understanding. Concrete cases and solutions become understandable and applicable for many. The documentary film can convey such cases. As a practice, it can also create a moment of understanding through its production conditions. Such collaboration allows for gaining territory and regaining ground under one's feet. Artistic methods of creating such collaborations are examined using three examples: occupied Palestine, the inaccessible caves of Lascaux, and Walter Benjamin's exile. The ability of the film medium to create feelings of bottomlessness is used. The corresponding techniques are used methodically when establishing a collaboration. The term ""autonomous camera"" means a camera movement that is not based on the action. Protagonists inevitably relate to these movements. The work required to determine this ratio forms the basis of the collaboration. The de-colonializing effect of this method is examined, i.e. to what extent it results in non-dominant co-production. Scientific and social context The research on the (alleged) end of Western dominance and on the prevention of hegemonic systems is supplemented with a new practice-based approach. With the film material, it makes an artistic contribution to the sensual experience and internalization of alternative forms of resistance.", Buchinger Jürgen, Mader Rachel

Treating therapists can ""book"" the social worker for individual hours or patient sessions and conduct discussions on social issues together with her and the sponsors or delegate them entirely to the social worker. The treatment team also receives advice on factual questions in the social work consultation hours, which take place monthly as part of the team meetings. At the same time, the social worker also conducts further training and information events on social work topics for the treatment team and in the area of work integration and insurance law for patients.

With them, decentralized producers of renewable energies will also be integrated into the energy distribution grids of the future. For more than 30 years, automation systems have been used in energy supply to operate and visualize the systems. In particular, the currently greatest challenge, the integration of decentralized producers of renewable energies in large numbers (photovoltaic, wind, combined heat and power plants) and the resulting significant expansion of existing business processes, cannot be addressed with the existing control technology concepts. The number of points to be monitored in the network will increase by a factor of 10 as soon as the desired energy transition is implemented. Employees will no longer be able to carry out quick troubleshooting or safe switching in the network without the explicit assistance of a control system. The concepts and conventional means of communication of existing control systems are not sufficient for integrated support. The Smart Energies project is researching a new, innovative generation of intelligent control systems with mobile and intelligent approaches to directly support employees and their work processes and to integrate them into the control technology process. Work processes are to be proactively managed by the control system with the help of intelligent methods from artificial intelligence in order to improve work efficiency and occupational safety and to meet the new challenges. This requires a direct integration of a range of new information on the workflows as well as an automated support of these workflows according to the roles of the employees in real-time and with trend-setting mobile approaches. Furthermore, employees must be able to communicate directly with the control system and be guided by the control system, regardless of their respective location. This requires a new generation of intelligent control systems to be able to record and manage this information and its relationships as well as the work processes with corresponding new and innovative models, so that an intelligent control system can anticipate the needs of the employees and ""think"" in terms of the work processes. The central importance of the integration of renewable energies for the security of the electricity supply in Switzerland is also expressly shown in the Energy Strategy 2050 of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE). This provides for guaranteeing our power supply security in the medium term without nuclear power plants, on the one hand by improving energy efficiency and on the other hand by expanding renewable energies. Under the collective term Smart Grid, the key technologies addressed by the Smart Energies project, innovative control technology equipment concepts and information and communication technologies (ICT), are of central importance."," Binder Gabriela,  Wilke Gwendolin,  Pouly Marc,  Jud Martin,  Handschuh Michael,  Christen Ramón,  Majeed Tahir,  Boillat Thomas", Meier René

Dupont's Sentry Glass Plus, also known as SGP, is used as an interlayer between panes of glass. It is considered a high-quality alternative to the proven PVB films and is also ideal for bonding glass with chrome steel parts. This results in new possibilities for joining glass panes. The big advantage is the higher strength and significantly higher rigidity than conventional PVB films. However, the dimensioning of such connections depends on many parameters. Among them are temperature and load duration, which can significantly affect stiffness. In order to counteract these phenomena, the properties are massively reduced and large safety factors are used. With precise knowledge of the properties, the risks can be assessed significantly better and defined more precisely. In this work, these properties are to be determined based on tests and prepared for FEM analyses. A suitable material model is to be found through tests, which can best be matched to the real material behavior and can be modeled with FEM programs.

Several popular publications state that in regard to innovation, ambidextrous organizations are more successful compared to organizations that are incapable of balancing exploitative and explorative activities appropriately (Duncan, 1976; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). However, several scholars (Hansen, 1999; Raisch & Tushman, 2016) argue that further research is needed in order to shed some light onto the often concealed intra-corporate interactions between exploitative and explorative units. It is that frontier, that enables and hinders the information and ideation exchange of radical and incremental innovations(Kraner, 2018). Thereof the paradoxical association between exploration and exploitation derives, that exploration generates opportunities that ensure indirectly future exploitation and exploitation ensure income to finance indirectly future exploration whereas exploration and exploitation suppress each other directly (Lavie, Stettner, & Tushman, 2010). Regarding the information and ideation exchange between the explorative and exploitative side, the said paradox was adopted with the findings of in-depth case studies by Kraner (2018). It is of interest how particularly the practical boundary spanning manifests itself taking into consideration the existing formal boundary activities. More insights into intra-corporate ambidextrous boundaries regarding the innovation processes and their direct impact on innovation success proposes valuable knowledge to the industry and practitioners, as well as the current body of knowledge of innovation management and the ambidexterity domain. It is expected that formal interaction between the exploitative and the explorative side positively affect innovation and therefore in a mid- and long-term perspective efficient processes/continuous innovation and successful new products. The expected results are that boundary spanning interactions positively mediate successful radical innovation as well as in reverse, incremental innovation too.",," Kraner Jan,  Hanisch Christoph"

As a core phenomenon of the future world of work, mobile, flexible working is a complicated and complex challenge for society. Constantly developing communication and information technologies, greatly improved transport carrier systems, an increasingly flexible work organization and the social development of the multi-option society enable more and more forms of work such as home office or mobile office. As a result, flexibility and self-determination are becoming increasingly important for employees when it comes to the organization of work on the part of the company. Companies increase their attractiveness as employers if they take a step towards accommodating employees in terms of working hours and work location. And through the intensive use of modern information and communication technologies, an increase in efficiency can be achieved. However, making work more flexible in terms of location and time also harbors risks for working society and the social order surrounding it. The constant availability of mobile work can have negative consequences for private and family life. A strict separation between work and other areas of life is therefore important, but performance-related pay, outsourcing, home office and mobile working contribute to the dilution of these boundaries. The ""flexible new world of work"" project examines topics such as the importance of paid and unpaid work and the characteristics of new forms of work, including their legal provisions and economic effects.

On behalf of the canton, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts analyzes the current control of integration promotion, develops criteria for good organization, drafts a control model and develops implementation recommendations. Security, prosperity and an attractive labor market make Switzerland an attractive destination for migrants. The majority of immigration concerns so-called labor migration: foreigners move to Switzerland within the framework of the free movement of persons or third-country quotas in order to pursue gainful employment here. A smaller area includes the so-called refugee migration: people in need seek protection in Switzerland and apply for asylum. At the end of 2016, 3.1% of the foreign population was in the asylum process. In particular, the free movement of people with the European Union has caused immigration to Switzerland to increase sharply in the last 15 years. By promoting or demanding integration, civil society and politics have reacted to social problems that arise from the lack of or insufficient integration of the immigrant population. The management of integration policy and the implementation of coherent integration promotion is a complex and demanding task because different policy areas and a large number of public and private actors are involved. We therefore understand the promotion of integration as a vertical joint task (coordination of the Confederation, cantons and municipalities), horizontal cross-sectional task (coordination of policy areas), public management task and political control task. The research project comprises four project phases Situation analysis: We interview the actors involved in promoting integration and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current management. Development of criteria: We compare the integration promotion of the Canton of Zurich with other cantons and develop criteria for a well-organized integration promotion.

Siri, Alexa & Co. have conquered living rooms, bedrooms and offices via so-called intelligent loudspeakers like Amazon Echo or Google Home. More and more people use the voice-controlled devices to play music, make searches or control smart home devices.

The project aims to provide new insights into how people deal with the challenges posed by the increasing invasion of privacy by language assistants. To this end, VA PEPR investigates how these affect everyday patterns of action and routines as well as the interaction and social relationships between the members of a household. By focusing on the home environment, user experience and ethical issues, the project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this new technology.

In a project already implemented by the authors, it could be shown that in a booming market, music criticism increasingly acts as an assessment body and filter by focusing on a limited selection of performers and products. It has not yet been clarified whether this development is actually intended and what effect music criticism has on consumer and purchasing behavior on the one hand and on the development of a canon of musical performances on the other. The present project contributes to the clarification of these questions. It examines the function of criticism in the classical music market from the perspective of critics and consumers and identifies the characteristics of music criticism that most influence consumption and purchasing behavior. The study uses interviews and experiments, as well as questionnaires and qualitative text analysis. The project will provide an in-depth understanding of music criticism-induced and psychologically motivated consumer behaviors. This understanding forms the basis for a more targeted and effective approach to music criticism, especially with regard to the disorientation caused by the music market, which can hardly be overseen today."," Baldassarre Antonio,  Rose Dawn Carole,  Rose Dawn,  Szamatulski Katrin,  Kirschstein Natalie,  Senn Olivier,  Carreras Sandoval Victoria Jane"," Alessandri Elena,  Baldassarre Antonio"

Here the participants maintain networks in personal relationships. In many fields of work, social work relates to families and other forms of life. Above all, social work and social pedagogy, but also socio-cultural animation come into contact with different ways of life. Everyone is talking about the ""pluralization of life forms"" and is well captured by the demographic concept of the ""second demographic transition"". In the theoretical range of interpretations, three concepts in particular have stood out. They are associated with the terms ""personal relationships"", ""private forms of life"" and ""ego-centric networks"". However, these conceptions seem in need of clarification. The modal structuring theory offers a good basis for such a clarification and an alternative theoretical conception based on it. She takes up the traditional notion of community and conceives it as one area of life among others, which is based on six institutions of comprehensive systems of implicit and explicit rules in the sociological sense. Based on the six institutions of the community, namely primarily partnership, parenthood, household community and secondarily friendship, kinship, neighborhood, ""communal forms of life"" can be determined. As a result, it is of interest for social work how these communal forms of life can be described and explained in more detail. The research project not only provides the theoretical basis for this, but also empirically researches the life situations of communal life forms by means of secondary analysis of selected data sets, i.e. network analyses.", Villiger Simone, Husi Gregor

Are there deviations? In German-speaking Switzerland, social work in schools is widespread and has a lasting profile. There are cantonal efforts to implement social work in schools across the board, and various research projects and publications enable a differentiated, practically relevant location for the school-specific field of action of social work. However, it is still unclear to what extent the expectations between the specialists in the school and the social work in the school agree or differ. The research project, in cooperation with the Lucerne University of Education, is investigating this research gap in order to facilitate and strengthen the demanding cooperation between school social workers and school specialists. The project examines the following questions: What do teachers, head teachers and school social workers have in common and differences in terms of the expectations of the services to be provided by social work in schools? What do teachers, head teachers and school social workers have in common and differences in terms of the expected impact of social work in schools? Any differences vary depending on the framework conditions (including models) of social work in school. The study includes both urban agglomerations and rural regions as well as several cantons in order to obtain a maximum variation of the SAS models. On the one hand, the selected cantons (BE, LU, BS, TG, GL, SO) cover the three largest urban agglomerations in German-speaking Switzerland and still allow rural regions to move in. In addition, all affiliation models exist in these cantons. For each selected school, the head teacher, the school social worker and 15 class teachers are interviewed. This results in a multilevel analysis design with two levels: school (headmasters and school social workers: N = 80 each) and teachers (N = 1200). The three groups of people are interviewed with the same instrument, which allows a comparison of the respective expectations and perspectives."," Seiterle Nicolette,  Keller Sarah,  Ziegele Uri", Gschwind Kurt

Socio-educational family support represents a form of outreach help for education, which supports families in challenging life situations over a limited period of time. In terms of its potential to prevent a further deterioration in an already stressed family situation, this is the most important outpatient basic service provided by child and youth welfare in Switzerland. Against the background of the empirically solid concept of loss aversion, it can be assumed that there could be a connection between the financial consequences for the families and the use of socio-pedagogical family support. According to the concept of loss aversion, the cost consequences of a decision are weighted twice as high as any gains in decision-making processes. This would mean that the impending financial losses would mean that parents would be more likely to decide against using paid social-educational family support instead of opting for it. Especially since any gains in development opportunities for their children remain relatively abstract for parents, while the financial loss can be quantified in concrete terms in the costs that can actually be expected. This has adverse consequences primarily for the children affected, but also for society. Since it can be assumed that financially weak families in particular will refrain from using socio-pedagogical family support due to the higher weighting of (deferred) financial losses in the form of debts to the municipality and that the scope for action for these families will be greater if there is no arrangement, the research project focuses on families entitled to social assistance and non-arranged socio-pedagogical family support.", Masoud Tehrani Anoushiravan, Metzger Marius

Sports events are one of the most important areas of the sports system with a correspondingly high level of interest. Against this background, the event scorecard developed by the research network was successfully established as an instrument for the differentiated measurement of the effects of sporting events. So far, the focus has primarily been on the economic effects of sporting events. Sporting events also have notable effects on the awareness and image of destinations, location promotion and other areas (e.g. regional development). This became clear with the example of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Having tools that record both quantitative and qualitative impacts corresponds to a broad interest.

The project urbain ""Langäcker Moves"" in the municipality of Spreitbach aimed to support the socio-spatial development in the quarter. Both living together and structural measures were developed and implemented in sub-projects. Spreitbach is an agglomeration municipality in the Limmattal development corridor between Zurich and Baden with approx. 11,000 inhabitants. It is a center of regional importance and far-reaching charisma - especially due to the shopping centers. Around 4,000 people live in the Langäcker district, almost 40% of the population of Spreitenbach. The district is characterized by a high level of national diversity and a rather younger population. A special feature of the quarter is the high proportion of condominiums, which are often rented out by Swiss residents to foreign residents. The project urbain ""Langäcker Moves"" in the municipality of Spreitbach aimed to use the external stimulus from the planned Limmattalbahn as a trigger for socio-spatial development. In the socio-cultural analysis (first phase), the integration needs of the neighborhood population were determined and the corresponding development of offers was designed. In addition to key people, children, young people and adults from the neighborhood also took part. The focus was on two aspects: strengthening coexistence by creating a meeting place and strengthening neighborhood initiatives. The CaféBAR was opened as part of an initiative by residents of the district, which can be expanded into a meeting center in Spreitenbach in the medium term. In the area of housing and building stock as well as the living environment, area-specific strategies for the renewal and renovation of the building fabric were developed with the involvement of the owners.

The process should enable the processing of recycled textile fibers. Imagine a piece of clothing that grows three-dimensionally from textile fibers in a single digitally controlled production step, thus combining several production steps and offering unrivaled freedom of form. The process is particularly suitable for short-staple fibers so that recycled textile fibers from used clothing and industrial waste could be used. For example, a complete outer garment or a shaped shoulder area would consist of this soft textile material as a three-dimensional molded part. Textile manufacture today is characterized by the manufacture of flat goods and their subsequent conversion into products. This is a chain of production processes, with the ready-made manufacturing being the most labour-intensive and at the same time the least automated area of production. The desire for individually shaped pieces, whether due to a tailor-made product or an individual room solution, poses challenges for the textile chain. In the field of knitting and warp-knitting, there are already limited three-dimensional manufacturing techniques that exclude or minimize ready-made clothing. For example, a knitted textile surface can be formed by adding and reducing stitches. In the field of nonwovens, there are no processes for the direct production of three-dimensional parts, only those for limited post-forming or artisanal practices. The aim of the project is therefore the development of a digitally controlled manufacturing process for the rational production of differently shaped textile products made of fiber material. Depending on the material and design, these expand the traditional areas of application with efficiently manufactured individual pieces, individually designed shapes or site-specific interior design solutions with acoustic properties."," Adler Françoise,  Hügli Joel,  Schmidt Lea,  De Angelis Marco,  Provini Markus,  Jabornegg Sascha", Wehrli Daniel

Condominium ownership was recognized as a form of ownership in Switzerland in 1965 and is enjoying increasing popularity. Based on the number of building permits granted for new apartments over the past 10 years, condominium ownership is currently the most popular form of ownership. However, due to complex decision-making processes between the owners, maintaining and renovating these StWE properties is not easy. It can be observed that decisions about necessary renewals are delayed, not made at all, or are made with an insufficient strategic, long-term orientation. This is due to the fact that the planning and construction of StWE properties is concentrated on the point in time of the sale and the handover of the special legal parts - the areas in the exclusive right of use. The long-term maintenance (incl. renewal) of the common parts and its cost consequences are largely beyond the consciousness of StWE buyers and StW owners. Due to a lack of information, communication and a lack of long-term strategies such as instruments for maintenance and renewal, increasing complications in the preparation, planning and financing of necessary renewal measures can be assumed, especially in the case of older StWE properties. In this respect, the objective of the research project ""Long-term strategies in condominium ownership"" at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) in cooperation with various business partners was to develop a toolbox for StW owners, investors and administrations of StWE, which contains practical instruments for process optimization and knowledge transfer.

The development of sustainable thermal storage technologies at relevant temperature levels, that are associated with low costs in production and maintenance, and can deliver the high heat transfer characteristics required by many applications is therefore an important research topic. Latent Heat Storage technologies (LHS), using Phase Change Materials (PCM) allow for compact and reliable storage of thermal energy as they can offer a higher volumetric energy density at a more constant temperature level in comparison to conventional sensible storage. However, most conventional PCM systems suffer from low heat transfer rates and require the implemetation of complicated and costly heat exchangers to achieve a higher thermal power output.

Scattered settlements characterize the cultural landscapes of various cantons, especially the canton of Obwalden. The further development while preserving the building culture and landscape-defining characteristics is demanding and poses great challenges for communities, since the demands of the most diverse groups have to be balanced. For example, the structural change in agriculture creates corresponding pressure on the building stock and the landscape. In order to design this change with quality, a comprehensive socio-spatial consideration is necessary.

However, the procurement works exclusively by telephone and email. With this technology, we offer a new, digital alternative to the conventional way of booking temporary housing for the procurement of temporary housing in Switzerland. Our goal is to significantly optimize the booking process for temporary living space. By disclosing the offer and booking processes, we create a new market transparency and support decision-making at all levels with data as a basis. Currently there is no technology resp. Platform in Switzerland, where a view of the market or the price and supply development is disclosed. The demand can currently only be based on trust and experience. The publication of the processes creates the opportunity to offer new offers on a well-founded data basis. The demand side can thus discuss which offers are within the scope of the price development. This newly created transparency creates a clear USP for Nest, but also added value for the market. The continuous publication of the data supports the decision-making process and thus ensures a recurring flow of bookings. Platforms such as those from Oakwood, Bridgestreet or Vision offer this service on an international level. Their services are suitable for international corporations that transfer personnel across countries. Our service is for companies that are domiciled in Switzerland, recruit staff abroad and bring them to Switzerland.

The IS-CreaLab project JUST ARCHITECTURE? invents research methods as frameworks of spatial experimentation enabling the exploration of the dynamics and identities in both architecture and research through research practice. The IS-CreaLab project JUST ARCHITECTURE? realizes conferences and exhibitions related to the double meaning of the word ‘just’: architecture as more than only architecture, and ‘just’ architecture as a correct/fair architecture. First, it considers an extended notion of architecture as ‘emergent reality’ that can be measured in terms of encounter, including the production of architecture, the object of architecture as a dynamic element, and the events taking place within architecture. The second question regards the foundation of authority, the difficulty of decision-making, and therefore the identity of architecture. These two questions, the dynamic and identity of architecture, are united in the word ‘just’. The project makes these questions methodically happen as ‘just research', hence, exhibits them not as pre-existing things but as a coming into existence. It therefore performs a shift from fixed image to dynamic image for both architecture and research. At the sic! Raum für Kunst, Lucerne, and the Swiss Architecture Museum S AM, Basel, the project tested the architectural competition. If architecture is understood as a reality emergent from dynamic constellations and constructive processes, what insights can new models of competitions provide for the understanding, making and teaching of architecture. At the FUGA Centre of Architecture, Budapest, improvisation in architectural education was examined. If architectural production demands high competences in improvisation, how can architectural improvisation be taught and practiced. By methodically applying the issues (competition, improvisation) to the systems of research (conference and exhibition, including calls, submissions, selections, lectures, and publications) variations are tested and measured as live spatial experimentations. Conferences and exhibitions are not innocent tools but spatial agencies functioning in just the same ways as architecture. The variations that were tested performed shifts from ‘practice’ to ‘gesture’: Use of video instead of written text. Use of web platforms as communication tools. Use of keywords connecting participants. The splitting of conferences and exhibitions introduced the notion of model. Use of exhibition spaces for conferences. Involvement of jurors confusing the roles of design and judgement. Launch of re-calls allowing to bypass direct selection. Participants: V. Katona, Budapest University of Technology and Economics. A.

Some of the properties make it very useful. But plastics drawbacks has become a large-scale problem which needs a global response. The Plastics waste impact on societal wellbeing, economy, and environment has already triggered the need for a new Plastics Economy movement (1). The recent “The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics (2) and “The New Plastics Economy: Catalysing action” (3) reports by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, now set the vision of a global economy in which plastics never become waste, but become an asset which can inspire and mobilize innovative solutions. This new plastics economy vision of immediate effective actions gains wide acceptance and momentum as proven by Gartner’s (4) report of top very high-profile vendors who are committed and recently announced zero waste to landfills goals (via the popular „4 R” approach: reducing, reusing, recovering, recycling). PTwist aims to design, deploy, and validate an open platform which will twist plastic reuse practices, by boosting citizens awareness, circular economy practices, and sustainable innovation inline with the new plastics economy vision. This will be achieved by offering: crowdsourcing tools to enable generation of an evolving plastic materials reuse taxonomy and an open plastic reuse machinery designs repository; a monetary system of PCoins and PWallets maintained by a blockchain based architecture which will safeguard trusted plastics reuse transactions among citizens and inventors (such as fablabs); a citizens and communities rewarding and engagement experiences by interactive and collaborative gamification which embeds Pcoins crediting; a virtual marketplace for exhibiting and commercializing of PTwist inspired plastics reuse products monetized in the proposed PCoins unit. Cutting edge gamification, analytics, and circular economy mechanisms will be integrated under an open platform to be validated and stress tested under a common use cases methodology. Three local and globally synchronized pilots (Switzerland, Netherlands and Greece) will intensify stakeholder (citizens communities, inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs) involvement and engagement, with emphasis on the social gains and sustainability potential. PTwist will largely impact : citizens and grassrooted groups co-creation, innovative and trusted collaboration and knowledge transfer by increasing all stakeholders awareness; plastics as an asset potential due to increasing its circular economy re-entering; and blockchain based novel routes to markets. Innovation activities in PTwist will be based upon existing open source, blockchain, gaming, crowdsourcing components, open data solutions and developments to the largest possible extent."," Caduff Ana Nicolasa,  Harboe Julie,  Frey Schär Myriam", Wolf Patricia

The energy consumption of a building is directly related to its façade. Multi-functional and adaptive building envelopes can provide step-change improvements in the energy efficiency of new and refurbished buildings while improving the wellbeing of building occupants.The review of existing façade systems and ongoing research show that transparent and opaque façades are generally considered separately. This is why a new hybrid façade system, a transparent–opaque solar façade which incorporates seasonal adaptive daily solar-gain management to achieve an improved energy balance – is proposed: the solar-energy balanced façade (SEBF) system. The idea is to improve the thermal performance of the transparent part by utilizing the opaque thermal mass with a minimum amount of technical installation. While the basic structure of the facade meets the current static requirements, the additional adaptive features provide a much better adaptive energy performance. The SEBF supports HVAC systems rather than hindering or restricting their function, which satisfies the basic requirement of system separation."," Arnold Kilian,  Wüest Thomas", Luible Andreas

Based on a large data set of fund characteristics we apply machine learning methods to predict future fund performance. The ex-ante identification of outperforming mutual funds, measured by a positive risk-adjusted return (alpha) after fees, is a very challenging and difficult task. However, several empirical studies (Kosowski et al., 2006; Barras et al., 2010; Fama and French, 2010; Kacperczyk et al., 2014) provide evidence that a subset of fund managers posses skill to outperform a passive benchmark after fees. In order for investors to benefit from this skill, an ex-ante identification of these fund managers is required. In this context, academic research has documented the ability of various characteristics at the fund-, the fund-firm-, as well as the fund manager-level to predict future fund performance (alpha). The aim of this project is to create a novel and unique database consisting of proprietary and public data (provided by commercial data vendors) for various markets (US, UK, Germany, Switzerland etc.) that can be used by investors (e.g. pension funds, wealth manager, private banks) to exploit any predictability about fund performance found in the data.

Sustainable Migration in North and West African Cities (WelCit) Welcoming Neighbourhoods: Sustainable Migration in North and West African Cities"" (WelCit) seeks to understand how internal and international human mobili­ty impacts cities in the Global South. The future of global settlement is in densified urban spaces. In the next few dec­ades, urban inhabitants are expected to increase to at least 60 per cent of the global population, and the increasing differentiation in modern societies is most pronounced in cities, especially in urban areas with a highly mobile population. Cities in the Global South are expected to experience the highest rates of urban growth. In Africa, mobility is a significant contributor to urbanisation, especially in­ternal rural-urban and South-South movements (UN-Habitat 2014).While cities are engines of production, innovation, and growth, urbanisation can also have a negative impact on local and global pollution, equality, and health. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits to making ""cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (Goal 11)"". The global urban agenda, including Habitat III (Quito, October 2016), encourages planning for the transition to sustainable cities. Thus, a key question for our future is: how can cit­ies develop such that their mobility-induced growth does not negatively impact the health and wellbeing of the population, increase economic and ecological risks, or raise the likelihood of discrimination and conflict? The interdisciplinary project ""Welcoming Neighbourhoods: Sustainable Migration in North and West African Cities"" seeks to understand the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion dynamics among mobile people (internal and external migrants, cir­cular migrants, commuters) in specific neighbourhoods characterised by diversity (in terms of the life histories, and particularly the mobility experiences, of the people who live there) and their contribution to social, economic, and cultural in­novation.

The final outcome of this project was a novel descriptive model of critical review of recorded performance that captures four critical activities – evaluation, descriptive judgement, factual information and meta-criticism – and seven basic evaluation criteria on the aesthetic and achievement-related value of performance reliably used by critics, plus two recording-specific criteria: live-performance impact and collectability. The present project investigates the generalizability of this model across different critical review outlets and cultural and linguistic backgrounds. To this aim, the previously developed model will be used as tool to analyse two new corpuses of recorded performance critique extracted from the U.S. online magazine Fanfare, and Rondo, the widest-circulated specialized classical music magazine in the German speaking area (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, SüdTirol).

The research project “Broadcasting Swissness” investigated the construction and distribution of “Swissness” by means of traditional and popular music. At the core of the research project was the “Dür collection” – a convolute of approximately 8,000 audio tapes with “Swiss popular music” collected by the musicologist Fritz Dür on behalf of Swiss Radio International (SRI) between 1957 and 1967 as a musical Swiss visiting card. The collection was taken up into the Swiss National Library in 1987. The central question of the whole project was how and under what social and institutional circumstances popular music together with the institution radio did emerge as a powerful voice in the construction of – an acoustic – Swissness. – The project was interdisciplinary and examined the acoustic dimension of popular culture from the immediate post-war period to the present from the perspectives of music studies, ethnomusicology, and cultural anthropology. The joint analytical approach of all sub-projects towards the material was based on the question of the nature of the acoustic construction of a “Stimme der Schweiz” (Voice of Switzerland) by means of its fixation on a recording medium, which had its own influence as a form of media. The collection had a canonising function and stimulated the formation of an integrated ideal of acoustic Swissness.

The role of energy storage is subject to an intense debate internationally. This debate reflects a lack of consensus to date around the techno-economic potential and respective merits of the various energy storage technologies at play due to the wide spectrum of possible applications and markets, as well as the potential to deliver multiple services, which makes the economic assessment difficult. When it comes to the potential of energy storage in Switzerland, no comprehensive cost-based analysis considering the potential role of bulk and distributed technologies has been performed to date that could inform a comprehensive national energy storage strategy. The objective of the proposed research project is to address this gap by performing a holistic investigation of the role of competing and/or complementary electric, thermal and chemical energy storage technologiesin achieving greater penetration of renewable energy technologies and more efficient and effective use of energy in the context of the Swiss energy transition. In the first task, comprehensive, detailed and robust information and data on the status of, and prospects for, technical and cost performance of selected storage technologies will be collected to serve as a basis for an expert elicitation exercise. Expert elicitation will use a formal methodology and dedicated, structured protocols to account for expert judgment beyond well-established knowledge. This will help identify drivers of future cost reduction and technical improvement, and deliver cost and performance estimates under a range of scenarios. All storage and conversion technologies retained after pre-screening will be characterized with a set of parameters describing these at an appropriate level of detail for techno-economic modelling and optimization. As second task, two distinct but complementary models will be developed to allow for a comprehensive investigation of energy storage.

The role of the entrepreneur has already been pointed out as an important factor for the internationalization decision process in the 1960’s by Aharonis’ behavioral theory (1966). Nevertheless, relevant literature today still lacks the explicit consideration of decision makers’ gut feeling as key element in the preliminary phase of internationalization decisions. The gut feeling is considered important before classic, (ex post) rational decision models can be fallen back on (Hodicovà, 2008). Furthermore, scientific discussions have only started recently to include social relationships and networks as relevant factors in SMEs’ internationalization process (e.g. Fabian et al. 2009). Carlsson and Dale (2011) have created the term „preactivity“ in their study, which compared to the regular terms like „reactive“ and „proactive“, stands for the capabilities and competences of a company, which facilitate (sudden) opportunities that are part of a network, which can be discussed, recognized and used. Since SMEs have scarce resources they often have no other choice than to rely on the intuition of leaders characterized by trust, confidence and self-confidence and to follow their decisions (Schweer/Siebertz-Reckzeh, 2012). The problem here is that the conscious openness and social acceptance for such an intuitive and emotional decision procedure remains limited in companies (Gigerenzer 2008). This hinders the awareness and usage of SMEs’ potential weaknesses as actual strengths or to at least to recognize them as a potential if balanced with rationality (Schreier/Frik, 2012). According to the author’s argumentation, a successful SME decision maker needs to consider intuition rationally. Therefore, decision makers consciously disclose intuition and allow discussions in the social network – meaning in their network of relations (Kuhlmeier/Knight, 2010). Nevertheless, this also means that the leader has to decide not only how much intuition is facilitated at which point in the decision-making process but also how much rationality is enhanced. Hence, a rational and explicit usage of intuition as a basis for decision-making becomes the last resort for the SME decision maker. We assume that SMEs are forced to take recourse to other sources than their larger peers are won’t to use when preparing their decisions (cf. e.g. Glückler 2006; Crick/Spence 2005). In this respect, the following resources are deemed relevant: The personal competences and experiences of the decision-makers, the networks into which they are integrated, and the trust and belief in themselves and their abilities as decision-makers (Schreier/Dievernich/Gong 2013), in their experiences and their networks, and in their own intuition, commonly referred to as “gut feeling”.", Zemp Markus, Schreier Claus

We must not only control the generation of future space debris, but also establish mitigation technologies to remove existing ones to ensure the sustainable utilization of near-Earth orbits. Debris removal technologies are collectively called Active Debris Removal (ADR). The capturing and rendezvous processes are among the most important and difficult processes involved in ADR. These processes are critical because an unexpected collision with the target may cause not only the mission to fail, but also additional generation of space debris. In practice, the high cost of ADR systems is a major obstacle to their implementation. There has been so far not enough impetus to fund space debris mitigation. In order to effectively realize it, we need both public awareness and a significant reduction in development costs. One of the most important factors in reducing the cost of space systems is the utilization of terrestrial technologies, especially Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components. Even though the space environment is different from the terrestrial environment, devices can be qualified using simulations. If we can utilize COTS devices with proper qualifications, we can develop space equipment with a high functionality and a very low cost. The orbit of an ADR satellite can be approximately controlled using orbit information, but the ADR satellite needs to identify the target debris orbit precisely to achieve a fine-tuned and safe rendezvous with the target debris. To autonomously access the target debris safely and reliably, an ADR satellite needs to have “eyes” to find the target debris and a “brain” to control the rendezvous process autonomously. This project focuses on the development of low-cost high-performance intelligent space cameras for guidance and navigation system of ADR satellites by effective utilization of COTS that will enable reliable mitigation of space debris."," Wyss Bettina,  Wassner Jürgen,  Rechsteiner Martin", Zahn Klaus

The vision of the SCCER Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts (FEEB&D) is to enable the reduction of the overall energy demand of the Swiss building stock by a factor of five during the next cycle of renewal of buildings by renovation or replacement without compromising on functionality, comfort or cost. The realization of this vision depends on new solutions at different levels and determines the structure of FEEB&D: WP1 Building Materials: Versatile high performance insulation materials based on aerogels for the retrofitting of existing buildings at a competitive cost level will reduce the energy demand for heating and improve comfort at the same time. Dynamic glazing will increase the use of daylight, foster solar gains in winter and reduce cooling loads in summer. WP2 Building Energy Management: Advanced predictive building control technologies will be developed in order to achieve significant efficiency gains by taking energy demand, supply from renewable sources, price fluctuations and grid services into account. Self-sufficient lighting systems will be based on optimally integrated high efficacy light sources and locally produced electricity. Thanks to building systems integration the overall efficiency of PV modules will be enhanced and the on-site use of direct current solar electricity will further improve the net balance. WP3 Urban Dezentralized Systems: The effective technical and economic potential of renewable resources at an urban and/or territorial level will be assessed by a geo-dependent energy database providing accurate demand and supply data, as well as methods and tools. A co-simulation platform will be developed to model urban energy systems consisting of multi-energy grids and energy hubs in order to evaluate the potential of alternative energy distribution systems. FEEB&D will set up experimental planning tools and facilities for low cost technical proof-of –concepts and on-site evaluations under realistic operating conditions. WP4 Socio-Economic Implementation: Economic performance and dynamics of technologies will be considered in order to assess the economic performance of selected key technologies in a dynamic and interdependent perspective. Organizational barriers to technology development and adoption will be examined in order to identify barriers and drivers to energy efficiency technology adoption by industrial firms, as well as the development and export of new products and services. Implementation of building energy efficiency technologies at large scale will be modelled and tools developed to assess different scenarios for the future development."," Seerig Axel,  Fankhauser Beat,  Dahinden Christoph,  Stettler Christoph,  Bless Claudia,  Hangartner Diego,  Jurt Dominic,  Gubser Frank,  Zweifel Gerhard,  Sfeir Joseph,  Vetterli Nadège,  Odermatt Peter,  Kräuchi Philipp,  Spörri Robert,  Sulzer Sabine,  Baumann Stefan,  Mennel Stefan,  Schluck Thomas,  Sommer Tobias,  Menti Urs-Peter,  Amrein Walter", Sulzer Matthias

Therefore, maintenance strategies are increasingly shifting from traditional preventive maintenance to more efficient approaches. Therefore, a novel approach for diagnostics of the power cabling using channel measurements of power line communication devices is proposed. There are mature methods available for performing wire fault detection during a maintenance process, primarily such ones based on reflectometry.The approach proposed here does not require the test subject to be taken out of service. Instead the goal is to use such a system in-situ, as a sensor network integrated into the power cabling systems which monitors the cabling with respect to anomalies and degradations which might lead to wire faults, and tries to locate such a degradation. The goal of this project is to develop a wire fault detection concept / algorithms via simulation and specific measurements for a point-to-point connection of two power line devices, in order to show to which extent reliable information can be obtained for the cable as test subject and investigate the influence of various parameters.If the results of this project are promising then a system concept for a PLUS Smart Wire system will be developed and will be proven in a follow-on innovation project (Innosuisse or EC Horizon Europe). The vision for such a system is an embedded and on-line wire-fault-detection functionality of a PLUS modem which, as part of a PLC network, senses the behavior of the transmission medium between the modems, i.e. the power distribution cabling / network, with the goal to detect and locate an existing or emerging wire fault."," Rebsamen Andreas,  Hofmann Christoph,  Ropraz Eric,  Dietrich Gerd,  Sadamori Leyna,  Bruderer Roger", Wassner Jürgen

The goal is to find bioproducts that have a high value and are compatible withsustainable material management so they can be used in space craft and space stations, where the focusis on manufacturing and recycling. Further, the sustainable material concept is based on the cradle tocradle (C2C) approach for biological and technical nutrients. For technical nutrientsgenerally being part of durables, the realization of one cycle of re-use is a significantimprovement already, and hardly feasible at 100% on earth. In space, disposal after single useis the rule so far, and in (too) many cases on earth as well. Biology, on the contrary, is truelycyclic by nature. Therefore, any consideration of bioprocesses must be seen in a - howeverlimited - biosphere environment, based on cyclic processes, to be reinforced by supply ofmaterial from space crafts. This true C2C approach requires that the chemicals used in thesecyclic processes are non-toxic, fully recyclable - thereby closing the material loop, userenewable energy for the manufacturing and for the supply chain, and conserve environmentalquality. The idea of C2C for biological materials is that they are produced by biological processes, canbe used as precursors for the technical cycle, and are non-toxic and so can be easily degraded.An example is high molecular weight polymers that are broken down by microorganismsproducing water, carbon dioxide and biomass, giving them the characteristics of a biologicalnutrient which can be input back into the biological cycle. Toxicity is defined by toxicity assaysand excludes chemical such as chloroprenes, heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Cd, Cr+6), and other highriskchemicals. However, the C2C concept also requires that non-biological materials (i.e. thetechnical nutrients) can be input to the biological cycle, for example many biological processesrequire metal salts (e.g. associated with the space craft) such as cobalt (Co), iron (Fe),manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) etc. in order to catalyze oxidation processes which, under theaction of heat and light, will break chemical bonds making the polymers biodegradable.", Egli Marcel," Granata Timothy,  Egli Marcel"

Today, the retrofitting sector in Europe is characterized mainly by on-site production, which may be inefficient with regard to cost and construction time. The sector is negatively associated with poor quality as well as an unsafe and unhealthy working environment. Facing also the enormous need for reduced energy use and renovation of buildings from the post-war era, these problems are reasons why an industrial construction process for retrofitting is needed. Based on seven demonstration projects in Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the UK, E2ReBuild was to investigate, promote and demonstrate cost-effective and advanced energy-efficient retrofit strategies that create added value for existing residential buildings and endorse end-users to stay and build a dynamic society. The project based on research and demonstration projects, which implemented new retrofitting solutions regarding planning, design, technology, construction as well as operation and use of the buildings. The results of the project are very multi-faceted. The demonstration projects, all completed by the end of the project, served as prototypes for the application, evaluation and monitoring of the new technologies. After renovation, they all showcase high energy performances and largely enhanced indoor environments. The planning, construction and monitoring process applied to the demonstration project is summarised in guidelines for architects, builders and local authorities. In addition, a new software tool – the European Retrofit Advisor – assists in analysing suitable renovation strategies for residential buildings at an early planning stage. The results of E2ReBuild show that modern industrialized processes cannot only save money by reducing building and energy costs but, they also create functional, attractive and individual housing for a great number of tenants. Also, they show that industrialized processes minimize technical and social disturbance for tenants, facilitating energy-efficient operation and use of the buildings. Latter, might encourage tenants for more energy-efficient behaviour.

The ventilation share is around 30% of the technical systems. To what extent can emissions be reduced by using alternative ventilation materials? Greenhouse gas emissions during the construction of buildings can account for far more in the annual balance than those during operation. Building technology accounts for around 18-23% of gray greenhouse gas emissions in buildings. The ventilation share is around 30% of the technical systems. In new buildings, the embodied energy of ventilation systems is between around 60 and 200 kWh per m2 of energy reference area. Ventilation distribution is responsible for around 50-65% of embodied energy, greenhouse gas emissions and the total environmental impact of ventilation systems. If you want to reduce the effort involved in creating ventilation systems, there is a lot of leverage in the main lines. Valuable approaches are, on the one hand, the reduction of the line length through optimized distribution concepts or low-tech solutions, on the other hand, the savings through the use of alternative materials, which entail less effort than the usual, galvanized ventilation ducts to reduce the embodied energy of ventilation systems compared to current practice and evaluated.

Prerequisites and possibilities of including performance art in collections Performance art is booming in exhibitions, it is hardly represented in collections. The live nature of this art form seems to be at odds with the demands of collecting. We develop innovative solutions together with museums and artists. Despite the increasing popularity of performance art, for example at biennials, but also in museum exhibitions, the resulting works have only been occasionally purchased for public or private collections. This has as much to do with the self-image of performance artists, who declare an authentic performance experience to be a central part of their intentions, as well as with the ephemeral nature of the works, which poses fundamental difficulties for collections. In the last decade, a few major museums (including the Tate Modern in London and the Salomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York) have developed models for purchasing live performances. Formats and modalities of the re-performance must be negotiated with the artists. Likewise, new curatorial and conservational competencies must be developed in the institutions themselves. This includes both practice-based and theoretical knowledge. The comparatively small Swiss museums often do not have the capacity for this. With regard to this initial situation, we are developing an online compendium as part of the research project and in cooperation with Swiss cooperation partners and artists as well as with international experts, in which the necessary knowledge is presented in a systematic way and case studies are presented. The project sees itself as application-oriented basic research. It combines action-based methods (including the development of artistic model cases) with theoretically based analyzes of topoi that shape the understanding and reception of performance art."," Fellmann Clemens,  Neukirchen Linda,  Bergmann Philipp,  Sykora-Götz Sandra,  Peyer Siri,  Brückle Wolfgang"," Mader Rachel,  Brückle Wolfgang"

Based on a cooperative chat across the tourism organizations, based on customer insights into social media and based on a joint analytics account, value could be shown to tourism professionals. The amount of data is increasing every day. So also in tourism. It is therefore obvious to use data secondarily. The challenge in tourism is that tourists use the services of many providers on a trip. Tourists therefore only know their guest to a limited extent. For example, the hotelier does not see in his data what his guest is doing during their stay and where he/she is moving. This is in contrast to cruise lines, which collect a large number of data points from their guests about their stay. In this project, tourism experts came together to try out the joint use of data using use cases and to introduce it if it made sense. - In the first use case, five participating partners made their Google Analytics data accessible to a central instance for the purpose of analyzing the customer journey. All partner websites receive a lot of internet traffic from (inter)national online platforms outside of the participating partners. In order to keep the surfing guests on the websites of the Lucerne tourism companies, a need for improvement in mutual linking and marketing was identified. - A cooperative chat tool was installed to accompany the guest communicatively across organizations via the chat tool. This is because guests keep asking questions that affect other tourism providers. Shortly after the introduction, guests were passed on fluently via chat from one to the organization and were thus advised with maximum competence. - In the Customer Insights use case, the aim was to gain cross-company knowledge about online guest behavior in the Lucerne Lake Lucerne Region and to generate further insights about the users."," Schmuziger Alina,  Liebrich Andreas,  Geyer Carolin,  Gächter Ingo,  Wyss Lucienne,  Zimmermann Luzia,  Müller Meike,  Wyss Melanie,  Stuber-Berries Nicole", Golliez André

One possibility is the production of microalgae, which have growth rates up to 50 times faster than fast-growing plants on land. Due to the highly efficient photosynthesis in water, CO2 can be extracted from the atmosphere with a very high area productivity. If the algae or carbon is subsequently stored geologically (“buried”), this removal is sustainable. In order to be able to quantify the potential of this process as a NET, life cycle analyzes are to be carried out in this project.

In the last few years, something has finally happened, particularly with regard to the statutory provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations. At the end of 2011, after many years of preparatory work, the Swiss Parliament approved a partial revision of the general accounting law (Art. 957ff. OR). An analysis of the new regulations shows that there is still a need for interpretation and that various questions will probably arise when it comes to the application of the new regulations.

Historical practices illustrate the need to take a closer look at current decision-making processes. Under the term ""child neglect"" far-reaching interventions in families were and are legitimized to protect affected children. However, the concept, forms, and naming of possible causes of child neglect that determine care practice vary significantly across time and discipline. Historical practices show that it is necessary to take a close look at current decision-making processes. We analyze features, mechanisms and modes of action of Swiss welfare practice in cases of child neglect. Our goal is to identify possible causes for practices that violate and protect integrity. To do this, we analyze current political/public discourses and expert discourses (2019) on family, upbringing and motherhood in five cantons, relate them to past ones (2009/2010) and compare them to the perspective of affected mothers. Historically, there were poor families and single mothers more likely to be affected by government intervention. Education was an important criterion for legitimizing state intervention, while the economic situation of families and unmarried mothers was marginalized. Parallels to these findings are also evident for the present and make it clear that current Swiss welfare practice in cases of child neglect requires careful analysis and reflection To reconstruct and analyze the connection with child neglect in order to be able to identify possible causes for practices that violate and protect integrity. The questions arise as to how the discourses are structured and how they affect decision-making processes, and whether a continuity of social disciplining mechanisms can be discerned. A systematic analysis of current and historical discourses generates knowledge about the effectiveness of implicit norms and provides indications of the need for change in the practice of social work, so that social work can be designed to support those affected and does not run the risk of increasing the vulnerability of affected families. Sensitizing professionals to reflect on their own normative images can help to prevent arbitrary decisions and the reproduction of power structures."," Pisoni Delia,  Le Maitre Francis,  Röthlisberger Michèle,  Niehaus Susanna,  Mitrovic Tanja"," Vogel Campanello Margot,  Niehaus Susanna"

Integrity risk indicators that have already been identified are validated in corporate practice. In the second sub-project, internationally active Swiss companies are companies that have their headquarters in Switzerland and are regularly active abroad. The particular challenge for these companies is that they operate in different values and cultures at the same time and have to do justice to a highly globalized environment. It is therefore particularly challenging to implement ethically correct conduct, transparency and compliance in day-to-day business life. With the help of the integrity risk indicators developed in the first sub-project, companies should be enabled to implement the principle-based compliance in accordance with ISO 19600 that is required today. In contrast to rule-based compliance, principle-based compliance requires that employees orientate themselves towards the values of the company as guidelines in order to be able to behave correctly in the respective situation. Employees are encouraged to think for themselves and make decisions that benefit the company. The values of the organization are elementary for the implementation of rule-based compliance. These serve to define behaviors, which are collectively referred to as corporate culture. The implementation and adaptation of these values can be subsumed under the concept of integrity (“doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking”). The integration of integrity risk indicators in the company-wide risk management system should enable the company to identify integrity risks (such as corruption) at an early stage and to take appropriate measures in a timely manner."," Renda Aline,  Unruh Anjuli,  Würzburg Antje,  Grünenfelder Franca,  Bauhofer Marc,  Salis Matteo,  Durrer Mirjam,  Hüter Philippe Patrick,  Brun Sascha"," Hunziker Stefan,  Durrer Mirjam"

For this, around 570 companies. Companies are required by law to take out an occupational pension solution for their employees. This obligation can be a challenge, especially for SMEs. To date, however, there are only a few empirical studies that shed light on occupational pensions from the point of view of companies and specifically the KUM. This study makes a contribution to this with a broad-based survey of companies. The aim of the study is to examine the following questions: How important is the topic of occupational pensions for companies in general? How much trust do companies have in their pension fund, and how transparent does it appear to the companies? How satisfied are the companies with the pension solutions they have chosen? What value do companies place on safety? (Risk tolerance / risk propensity) How important is freedom of choice with regard to pension solutions and providers? What does the decision-making process of the companies when choosing the pension solution look like? The survey shows that the issue of occupational pensions is important for companies, regardless of company size. At the same time, trust in the Swiss pension system is generally high. Companies want to assume social responsibility with an attractive pension solution. The companies have a great deal of trust in the pension schemes with regard to the provision of the promised pension benefits and rate the financial strength of the pension scheme as high. In addition, the pension schemes are perceived by the companies as transparent. The survey also revealed that the vast majority of those surveyed are satisfied with the pension solution they have chosen. The pension solution almost or completely covers the need for financial security. The majority of respondents are least satisfied with the comprehensibility of the documents. The need for security is high. Regardless of the size of the company and the pension solution chosen, the majority prefer security to returns. In addition, the majority of respondents are willing to pay a price for additional security. Guarantees therefore have a value in companies. The freedom of choice with regard to the pension model and the provider is important for the companies. While the freedom of choice with regard to the pension model is considered equally important for all companies - regardless of size - the freedom of choice with regard to the provider is significantly more important for SMEs than for large companies. In general, the survey shows that companies and specifically SMEs choose their pension solution consciously. The majority choose the model before the provider, and the pension offers are checked regularly or sporadically. Only a very small proportion have never examined alternatives."," Nadig Linard,  Aepli Matthias Daniel,  Oster Philippe", Seiler Zimmermann Yvonne

Company-specific topic-oriented online communities can make a decisive contribution to long-term customer loyalty. However, active participation by users is central to the success of an online community. The CTI project therefore aimed to answer the following three central questions from the practice of managing online communities: (1) Why are users active in online communities? (2) How can users be motivated to actively participate in online communities by using incentive elements? (3) What effect does the use of incentive elements have in online communities? Step 1: Identification of users' motives for participating in an online community In a first step, the motives of users of company online communities were identified. It turned out that a large number of different motivations explain the participation in online communities: the motivation to help, to make friends or to gain recognition are the main reasons. However, users also participate because they are interested and want to learn something, or because they want to protect themselves against risks. Many users are also involved in online communities because they enjoy it. Step 2: Categorizing the incentive elements that are used to motivate the target groups In the second step, the incentive elements used in practice were identified by means of expert interviews. Competitions usually require little involvement. In addition, content with added value is important in order to involve users at a low level and with little involvement. Ranking systems, feedback or other forms of recognition are further incentive elements that can lead to deeper engagement in the community. At the very other end of participation, users are given extensive autonomy, for example to create new products. Step 3: Measurement of the effect of the incentive elements on participation in online communities In a third step, the effect of the incentive elements on participation behavior was measured. Five online experiments were carried out. It turned out that the incentive elements have different effects depending on the type of community: competitions work in communities with a more short-term character, where information is the focus. In the case of expert communities in particular, profile information proved to be important for activating users. The findings from the CTI project were summarized in a consulting toolbox for the management of online communities. The toolbox contains guidelines for identifying the motives of the users of a community as well as specific recommendations for action to optimize participation in online communities."," Federspiel Esther,  Moosbrugger Eva,  Schwarz Jürg,  Breitenmoser Ria,  Kirchhof Samuel,  Mohr Seraina", Schaffner Dorothea

Using a literary method, we examine text strategies that enable travel customers to work on their imaginations. It is examined how marketing texts from the tourism industry activate the imagination of the readers through so-called blank spaces. Our study builds on the results of an empirical study (Wehrli et al., 2013). This study was able to show that certain linguistic strategies are particularly well suited to marketing sustainable tourism products. The concept of blank spaces goes back to the literary scholar Wolfgang Iser and has so far mainly been used to analyze the conditions of perception of fictional texts. The application of the concept to types of text in the tourism industry is profitable, since marketing texts from the tourism industry - eg brochures - are linguistically designed to create a utopian space. Often the imagination of the readers in the reception of the corresponding texts is the prerequisite for a later purchase of the product. On the one hand, the texts tested in our preliminary project (Wehrli et al., 2013) are to be examined from this new perspective, on the other hand, we also want to include multimodal texts in the investigation.

Scenarios are created for the influence of heat build-up on living quality and long-term real estate values. In the future, densification projects will have to be checked more closely for their climate compatibility. The identification and analysis of local urban heat effects and the development of countermeasures are primarily technical-physical and planning-structural disciplines. Pioneering projects are being promoted in these disciplines at various levels, for example by the Federal Office for the Environment, the Zurich and Lucerne regions, the universities of Central and Eastern Switzerland and the ETH Zurich. The project develops a socio-economic framework for the planning-oriented projects. Two questions are at the center of the project: How does climate change, especially the increasing heat, influence the different social contexts of the residents in neighborhoods and settlements? What scenarios result from this in terms of local quality of life, earnings and value development? Real estate economic scenarios are developed from qualitative social findings, with which cost effects of recommended planning countermeasures from related projects (in particular ITC neighborhood climate modelling) can be classified economically.

Various factors influence the shopping and mobility behavior of the population. Due to the temporary home office obligation and business closures, significantly more people have been working from home since the Covid pandemic and doing their shopping outside of stationary retail. For example, a sharp drop in frequency in stationary non-food retailing during the working week has already been observed. However, other factors also affect shopping and mobility behavior, such as rising inflation, energy shortages, delivery bottlenecks and rising mobility costs. Changes in the unemployment rate, the savings rate, purchasing power and price differences compared to other countries also play an important role. In general, a structural trend towards more online shopping can be observed. Omni and multi-channel concepts are increasing. The reduced mobility of post-corona (approx. 5% to 25%, partial continuation of home office) and thus the declining pedestrian frequencies in places with a high proportion of office space have an important influence on the decline in purchases from (purely) stationary shops. This raises the following questions for the retail trade: whether and to what extent has the purchasing and mobility behavior of the population changed due to current developments (working from home, inflation/price increases, shopping tourism, online trade, etc.)? What are the effects of changing mobility patterns and forms of work among the population on shopping behavior in the Swiss retail sector? Which trends in shopping behavior in the retail trade can be derived from this? What measures can and should the Swiss retail trade take to react to the changes (e.g. choice of location or adjustment of sales formats)? On behalf of the Swiss Retail Federation, the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) is investigating the impact of working from home, reduced mobility and rising inflation on consumer behavior, based on a broad-based impact model."," Hanisch Christoph,  Habermacher Florian", Lüthi Stefan

Devices, practices, images in art and everyday culture The project serves to research photographic practices against the background of digitization and networking of the production of images in everyday life, entertainment culture and art. Attempts to define the essence of post-photography, which insisted on an end to the photographic, have contributed little to his understanding. An examination of the changed conditions under which photography can take on meaning after the dissolution of traditional ideas of apparatus, image and image-producing practice, and the image machine as a model competing with the camera and the data flows in which images take shape, seems more fruitful. The researchers involved assume that post-photography can only be described in the interweaving of a network of actors, economies of image use, and aesthetic paradigms that encompass both people and devices. The focus is on the reappraisal of pictorial practices, for whose systematic cultural-scientific recording little has been done so far. In their studies, the project participants relate the areas of art, everyday practices and entertainment industry, which are mostly examined independently of one another, to one another in order to arrive at an appropriate understanding of photography. The focus is on the following questions: Which paradigms of photography feed the use of digital viewing machines in art and everyday culture; how can the post-photographic be determined in relation to this; how are the relationships between images, devices and practices shaped in it? Related investigations must include the role of mobile communication media, video gaming, artistic appropriations of immersive media technologies, and visual phenomena other than photographs in the traditional sense. The questions examined in the project are important for the assessment of current image culture beyond the areas of art and design in almost all areas of social life in Switzerland and beyond."," Weiberg Birk,  Fellmann Clemens,  Rentemeister Elke,  Tedone Gaia,  De Mutiis Marco,  Malevé Nicolas", Brückle Wolfgang

Many of the business models that have been extremely successful in recent years have one common feature: they are service-based. A service-based business model exists when the customer benefit is provided to a significant extent by a service, even if physical products are used to create the service. Examples are Hilti (“flat rate” for tool fleet leasing instead of selling tools), Apple (itunes and apps as a key differentiator for iphone, ipad, ipod) or car sharing (“renting” the usage times of a car). Nevertheless, the business models of most product manufacturers are still characterized by a low service orientation. According to a study by Neely (2013), in which more than 40,000 companies were examined, 69% of companies in the USA are not service-oriented, in Germany around 75% and in France over 80%. The reasons for this are the product thinking that is strongly anchored in these companies, which makes a service-oriented reorientation difficult, a focus on only product-related services (e.g. maintenance), a weak positioning of the service departments in the company and the lack of systematic concepts for implementing a service orientation. These findings were confirmed in the first expert discussions on this preliminary project, in which the companies expressed that there was a lack of an implementation-oriented approach to service orientation. With regard to the current state of research, Gebauer et al. (2011; 2013) use a bibliometric meta-analysis to describe phases of research on the subject of service orientation. In the first phase, there was only a focus on product-related services. In a second phase, research focuses on the transformation of companies from producers to service companies. According to the meta-analysis, the corresponding research is in a mature phase, while important perspectives of the topic have not yet been researched at all: First, the conceptualization of the change from product to service as a business model innovation, and second, the embedding of service orientation in innovative ability and market orientation. Based on the previous analysis of both the practical and the research perspective, the aim of the CTI project application intended with this preliminary project is to develop an approach for the development and marketing of valuable services. With the approach, services should be able to be developed that independently - independent of a product - create value (""value""), and a toolbox should be generated with which such innovative services can be developed and marketed.",, Georgi Dominik

Thus, instead of relying solely on expert opinion or quantitative market research and in order to circumvent the typical problems presented by forecasting the future, we suggest to take the position of customer perspectives through qualitative data gleaned from science fiction short stories written by a representative sample of (future) customers, which will then be validated by a pool of knowledgeable experts with interdisciplinary backgrounds.

The municipalities play an important role in the implementation of specific preventive measures. So far, there has been a lack of systematic processing of knowledge about success and failure factors and the effectiveness of community-based prevention projects. On the basis of a systematic analysis of current research literature, evaluation studies and documentation from practical projects in Germany and abroad, the current knowledge is to be processed in order to derive good practice recommendations for practice. The aim is to support the relevant stakeholder groups (project sponsors from cantons and municipalities, project managers, cantonal and regional specialist agencies, NGOs) in planning and implementing effective prevention projects at municipal level. The central questions of the research project are: What is the current status with regard to the theoretical justification and evaluation of community projects in Switzerland? What insights can be gained from this, also taking international research literature into account, with a view to relevant success and failure factors as well as quality and impact aspects? Which good practice recommendations can be derived from the current knowledge base for practice? Which language-regional differences have to be taken into account?

Based on the observation that participation in structural planning processes is in a difficult position, although successful participation - especially if it is supported by broad interdisciplinarity - could significantly increase sustainable development and stakeholder satisfaction. For this reason, criteria for better anchoring of participatory and interdisciplinary approaches in construction processes were developed in the project. Particular attention was paid to the role of design and art, disciplines that are usually forgotten in such planning processes and could make important contributions with their aesthetic and symbolic skills, especially in public space. These criteria were developed from the analysis of a number of different building processes in Germany and abroad in public spaces and in districts. Based on these criteria, it can be checked to what extent the respective participatory and interdisciplinary approaches (methods and instruments) are used expediently in combination of methods, sub-processes and procedures in planning and development. The results and findings on participation and interdisciplinary cooperation could then be implemented and tested in a practical manner in various teaching subjects and a jointly implemented model planning process (Charette). Important findings from the project, along with the development of a catalog of criteria, is the insight that interdisciplinarity as well as participation (in the planning of construction processes, in research as well as in teaching) is costly but profitable for everyone involved, provided that it is planned and carried out on the basis of real commitment and with goal-oriented methods."," Willener Alex,  Juppien Angelika,  Emmenegger Barbara,  Schumacher Jörg,  Sturm Ulrike", Spalinger Schär Veronika

Importance, development and their contribution to health and social care The main objective of the study planned by Self-Help Switzerland is to examine the current situation of community self-help in Switzerland and in particular to analyze the benefits and limitations. good ten years ago, the situation of self-help and self-help promotion in German-speaking Switzerland was systematically examined for the first time (Stremlow, Gysel, Mey and Voll 2004, Stremlow 2006). In the same period, a study on the situation of self-help was carried out in French-speaking Switzerland (Gognalons-Nicolet, Bardet Blochet, Zbinden 2006). The self-help movement in Switzerland has continued to develop over the past decade: for example, new self-help centers have been established and Self-Help Switzerland – the umbrella organization for regional self-help centers – has been making intensified efforts for several years to involve community self-help more closely with the health and social sectors and their institutions connect. In view of these efforts and the fact that research in the field of self-help in Switzerland has been almost idle for the past ten years, the Board of Trustees of Self-Help Switzerland has decided to carry out a current study on the meaning, benefits and limits of community self-help in to be implemented throughout Switzerland. The institutional support conditions for self-help are also of interest. Also with a view to the future – for example in the context of the Federal Council's “Health 2020” strategy – those responsible for Self-Help Switzerland consider it appropriate to examine the importance of community self-help more closely. The aim of the ""Health 2020"" strategy is to strengthen the health skills of those affected and to expand health promotion, prevention and early detection in a targeted manner and to integrate them more closely into overall care. It is precisely in these fields that community self-help unfolds its performance potential based on the current state of knowledge. The core of the study is the question of what contribution community self-help makes to healthcare and social care in Switzerland and what prospects there are for future development and promotion. Specifically, the study examines the importance of self-help at the 'micro level' (personal context such as the use of medical services, willingness to cooperate in the event of chronic illnesses, the general health behavior of self-help group participants), at the 'meso level' (institutional context such as cooperation between self-help centers with specialist agencies or with the health leagues) and on the 'macro level' (general importance of self-help for health and social affairs). Furthermore, it should be determined whether the current support for self-help is appropriate and sufficient."," Mühlebach Christine,  Meier Magistretti Claudia,  Berger Fabian,  Lanfranconi Lucia,  Müller Marianne,  Born Markus"," Stremlow Jürgen,  Lanfranconi Lucia"

We use state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tools to process a large amount of heterogeneous data gathered from various sources which include Twitter, StockTwits, Reddiit, Google Finance, Nexis, Google Trends and Wikipedia. Our research questions are then (i) whether sentiment analysis and internet activity variables provide predictive power when used jointly with a large set of other economic predictors, (ii) what is the nature of this potential impact, and (iii) how can this information be used to generate improved volatility predictions. Our proposed approach is based on Bayesian regression models with spike-and-slab priors. This allows for dealing with high-dimensional data and for doing Bayesian model averaging which results in improved predictions compared to using one single model. We will investigate various model extensions to account for phenomena such as regime switches, non-linearities, and interactions among predictors. In addition, we plan to apply a Bayesian regression model that jointly uses low-frequency and high-frequency return data to generate more precise volatility estimates and, consequently, predictions. In summary, the goal of the project is to contribute to the development of the next generation of volatility prediction models that combine sentiment signals with advanced statistical methods.",," Sigrist Fabio,  Sigrist Fabio"

We propose to investigate the views of the learning experience of design and business students in hybrid environments. Covid-19 was a catalyzer of online learning. Universities quickly moved into online platforms to help students acquire new knowledge and develop new skills. Design and business programs adopted Zoom, Miro, and other tools, and combined them with more traditional classroom approaches. This is an opportunity to learn and rethink hybrid learning practices to improve decision making processes when creating productive learning spaces. With this ITC project, we seek to identify the factors that support and hinder the learning experience of design and business students when learning different contents in two pedagogical approaches: lectures and studio classes. The preliminary findings derived from this study will lay the ground for the application of a larger follow-up study including Swiss design schools.", Grüter Ueli, Noël Fabiola Guillermina

If older people or high-risk patients can stay at home longer before or soon after hospitalization, an important contribution can be made to reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of life for patients. Therefore, health monitoring is one of the most important applications for wearable electronics being explored by many research groups. Various portable devices for monitoring physiological parameters are already commercially available today, and many more are under development. However, most of these devices are aimed at the recreational market (e.g. joggers) and are therefore not suitable for medical use in elderly or high-risk patients. The devices that have been qualified for medical use are mostly relatively simple, measure only a few parameters and offer little or no online analysis options. The SmartCuff project involves the development of a wearable medical device that continuously and non-invasively measures multiple vital signs to provide complete patient information. The device is especially intended for monitoring the health status of elderly people while they can still live in the comfort of their own homes.

In this project, we examine the potential impact of behavioral approaches, such as nudging, and examine individualized communication strategies. How can a sustainable mobility solution in the field of outdoor tourism in Switzerland succeed? In the course of the global climate debate, this question is of particular relevance. Especially when you consider that motorized private transport is still the biggest CO2 driver in this area. Around 50 to 70 percent of the CO2 emissions of a ski area can be traced back to this type of traffic. In order to reduce this footprint, more and more psychological approaches are gaining in importance in order to break through established patterns of behavior and thought (Milkman, 2021; White et al., 2019). For example, it is not just about the so-called framing of a train journey as a comfortable alternative, but also about the informative presentation of the real environmental costs of a car journey. Although many of these approaches are theoretically sound, there has so far been no empirical study of their actual effectiveness, especially in the field of outdoor tourism, where one should actually assume a high level of willingness in terms of sustainability (Winter et al., 2020). In particular, the question is open as to the extent to which mobility campaigns aimed at sustainability should be understood as an individualized strategy and which groups of people – analogous to target marketing – should be selectively addressed with specific content. In other words, what content needs to be communicated to which group of people from the outdoor area so that a change in behavior becomes more likely. Our hypothesis is that, for example, a senior hiking group has different motives and preferences than an urban small family on winter vacation and should therefore be addressed differently. Financial incentive may be the primary reason for choosing a particular mode of transport for some groups, while for others it may be the issue of carrying a lot of luggage."," Schöb Daniela,  Zimmermann Luzia,  Ohnmacht Timo"," Basel Jörn,  Ohnmacht Timo"

It develops performative soundwalks that will take place in spring 2022 in Altdorf, Kriens-Lucerne and Stansstad as part of the AKS project «Innards». How do the inner voices of Central Switzerland sound? What sounds inside our immediate surroundings? The inner voices are the acoustic innards that we can find in our heads, but also in interior spaces, in the inwardness of living beings and things. The planned project deals with interior spaces and inwardness of the sphere of sound. As part of the ""Innereien"" project initiated by the Albert Köchlin Foundation, ""Inner Voices"" listens to the inner voices of Central Switzerland and presents this debate on soundwalks in Altdorf, Stansstad and Kriens-Lucerne. «Inner Voices» is an artistic research project developed and implemented by the collective consisting of Patricia Jäggi, Martina Lussi, Christoph Brünggel and Tim Shaw. The collective examines various inner spaces and places with special acoustic inner workings such as caves, bunkers or churches; but also special sound places like the inner life in the dense reeds or in a remote forest are in focus to make this cosmos of inner voices audible. These interiors of Central Switzerland are acoustically explored with different miking techniques and later recorded on the walk alongside the live miking. During the soundwalks, everyone will wear wireless headphones, through which they will receive sounds wirelessly. Having these tones so close to the body and at the same time being shielded from the usual sounds of the outside world is intended to create a tonal intimacy, a closeness to one's own inner voice. In the live sound performances, the artists also work with contact microphones, underwater microphones and with making electromagnetic waves audible. The microphones are used as «instruments», the recorded sounds are mixed, filtered and looped live by the performers: sometimes as harmonious as possible, sometimes dissonant, condensed or isolated. The movement from outside to inside that is drawn over what is heard should also be carried out spatially. The walks end in an interior space remote from the everyday, familiar sound space, where the headphones are finally removed: a completely different listening experience.

The dissemination project was created in cooperation with municipalities that have tackled the task of internal development. The project bundled the knowledge from different perspectives in order to pour the experiences on the challenges of developing the center, revising the local planning and renewing private property with the help of participatory processes in publications. A cooperation with the Swiss association for spatial planning EspaceSuisse was won for the French version. The wide dissemination of the products increases the effect of the information provided on internal development.

The SEGEL team supports you in this. How can we create freedom (of choice) and at the same time do justice to our duty of care? Self-determination and an independent lifestyle are also key for people with a cognitive lifestyle; the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-BRK) expressly demands these rights. Aiming at the goal of the greatest possible self-determination of people with cognitive impairments demands a lot from institutions and specialists. This is particularly evident when it comes to ethical questions, which can arise from the tension between the right to self-determination and the duty of care. In this area of tension, many questions arise, such as: Is it actually correct that the specialists forbid the residents to drink alcohol because it is in the house rules? And should the fridge in the residential group be locked for everyone because Paul is getting fatter and fatter? If these and other questions bother you, then the SEGEL team can support you in finding solutions. You can book us. Our discussion guidelines developed in the project make it possible to discuss and decide on difficult questions on the subject of self-determination. And this is what people with and without cognitive impairment do together. Be it in a residential group, in the workshop, in the parents' council or in the leisure club (price on request). Upon request, we also conduct workshops, lectures and Socratic conversations on self-determination and difficult issues related to impairments. Please contact: judith.adler@hslu.ch or corinne.wohlgensinger@ost.ch The project The project consists of a development and a research part and is designed to be participatory. In the development part, a guide was drawn up for dealing with ethical questions, which are found in the area of conflict between self-determination and heteronomy. The guidelines make it possible for people with and without cognitive impairments to discuss these ""difficult questions"" together. The research part pursues the following goals: As part of the project, fundamental content-related questions about the importance of self-determination for people with cognitive impairments were clarified. We recorded our understanding of self-determination in a film. In addition, the instrument for deciding ethical questions was tested and evaluated in practice. The participatory approach to the project is reflected in the project team. What is special about this project? The project structure of the research and development project is just as participative as the project group itself. The aim of the development is an instrument for participatory decision-making. At the same time, the research methodology is designed to be participatory. People with cognitive impairments are not just the subject of research, but part of the project group.",, Adler Judith

His music moves between late romantic forms of expression and the expansion of tonal means, largely apart from the avant-garde currents of the time. His extensive catalog of works bears witness to this. But a lengthy medical history is also part of Burkhard's life and work. By chance, a collection of letters by Burkhard that were hardly known and at least not accessible as a whole, was donated to the music library from the private property of the Indermühle family, who were close friends of the composer, with the condition that at least some of them should be made publicly accessible. The project took on this task in cooperation with the library: It recorded the letters according to scientific criteria and in relation to Burkard's biography, evaluated the procedure for digital reproduction and as such prepared a selection of letters from the collection on the library's website. The latter can be found under the heading «Special Collections».

However, financial institutions have limitations and concerns about sharing data, making it difficult to realize its full potential. In particular, information about the financial situation is considered very sensitive and is protected by Swiss (e.g. data protection law and bank client confidentiality) and international laws (e.g. GDPR in the EU).

In general, data security involves protecting data in all its forms and states, i.e. in the rest state, during transfer and in use, respectively computation. There are proven options for the former states. For example, data is encrypted so that even if it is stolen, information cannot be accessed. There are also encryption that protect data in transfer so that only authorized parties can see the information as it moves between servers and applications.

Searching for a common ground: Social artistic practices and creative social work The workshop Can we meet? Searching for a common ground: Social artistic practices and creative social work aims at putting Sociocultural Animation and of Social Art in dialogue. We intend to clarify the shared interests as well as the divergences. With view to the ongoing social inequality, increasing heterogeneity and to the manifold divides in western societies, practitioners of the fields of Sociocultural Animation and of Social Art have raised similar questions: How can a coexistence between diverse communities and between individuals with unequal social or cultural capital be enhanced? How can divides be transformed into social bonds? And how can underrepresented groups actively participate in public life? In the context of these fundamental questions, Sociocultural Animation and Social Art operate with similar tactics and terminologies (participation, inclusion, community building, activation etc.). However, the two fields of practice are shaped by different historically grown self-conceptions, which come with specific approaches and theoretical discourses. When, for instance, practitioners of Sociocultural Animation speak of art, they mostly refer to creative practices or practices of aesthetic expression in general. They thereby do not transport the implications such practices have for artists. These go back to the criticism that the art discourse has brought forth based on the cultural theories of the late 20th century (such as post-colonial studies, queer studies, democracy studies etc.). On the other side, it seems often challenging for artists to take into account the logic of social work to their projects, which is based on an effect-oriented perspective that, not least, asks about the measurable impact of a project. The workshop aims at putting the different involved fields of practice in dialogue. We intend to clarify the shared interests of Sociocultural Animation and Social Art as well as their divergences. On this basis, we ask: To what extent are these fields and practices complementary? What can practitioners from either field learn from the specific approach of the other? Where are differences and frictions and how could they be made productive? What shared concepts and methods can emerge from this dialogue? The workshop creates an encounter of representatives of different fields who will discuss on chosen subjects that are essential for both perspectives, but interpreted and used in different ways. As an overall issue, we include the perspective on translocal practices as a way of linking global debates with local specificities. Point of departure for the discussion will be practice-based case studies. Based on the clarifications of the workshop and the therein built network we aim to develop an implementation-oriented research project.

Wood combustion is related to ambient air pollution by CO, organic compounds, particulate matter (PM10), and NOX. To increase the contribution of wood energy, technologies to achieve low emissions are needed. In addition, the use of low quality wood fuels is becoming more important. The aim of the project is to develop a multi-stage concept for biomass combustion in the size range from 500 kW to 50 MW. Special attention is given to different combustion sections on the grate assisted by multi-stage air injection. During the reporting period, the following progress was achieved: The instationary one-dimensional fuel bed model (FBM) was extended from one to four independent grate sections. Calculation runs show that a variable air distribution can be applied to control the combustion at varying fuel moisture content. Combustion experiments in the grate boiler were performed to investigate the influence of the air distribution and of the grate movement. Pyrolysis gas analyses were performed for the fuel conversion pro­cess, while flue gas analyses were performed for the gas reactions. The results show that the grate movement exhibits a dominant influence on the solid fuel con­version. To optimise the gas phase reactions, CFD modelling and aerodynamic model experiments with particle image velocimetry (PIV) were performed to investigate the secondary air injection described as a jet in cross flow (JICF). From these investigations, design recom­men­dations are derived."," Lauber Adrian,  Gwerder Damian,  Barroso Gabriel,  Correia Rodrigues Hugo,  Martinez Garcia Jorge,  Good Jürgen,  Hälg Léonore,  Kiener Martin,  Schwingruber Patrick,  Odermatt Peter,  Maranda Simon,  Roth Simon", Nussbaumer Thomas

However, non-ideal combustion results in high emissions of aerosol particles and gases. The latter may readily react in the atmosphere, producing secondary aerosol, which results in a substantially higher aerosol load from wood combustion than the primary (direct particulate) emissions.Multiple studies point to severe health effects of particulate matter (PM) from wood combustion, making these emissions a concern for air quality. Thus, there is a strong target conflict between promotion of the use of wood as an energy source and its implications for the environment and human health. This project aims at quantifying the emissions from combustion devices of different combustion devices and combustion regimes.

For this purpose, the advantages as well as the application and processing criteria for the material are examined and standardized. Wood-Plastic Composites (WPC) consist of a fossil-based plastic matrix in which up to 80% wood fibers are embedded, thereby relieving scarce oil resources. So far, WPC has only been used in the construction industry for outdoor applications in facades and terraces. In recent years, further production technologies have been developed in order to bring the compound into more varied forms of application. This also includes the flat press technology for the production of flat panels. Such semi-finished products can be used by further processors such as carpenters or industrial furniture manufacturers to produce furniture according to their own ideas or specifically according to customer requirements. The following questions should be clarified as part of the pre-development: Can WPC, as an ecological material, also be used to construct furniture indoors? What are the monetary benefits of using WPC in the mass production of furniture? Which constructive, creative and production-related criteria are ultimately decisive for product development?

During the Corona crisis, consumer behavior changed positively in various areas towards greater ecological, economic and social sustainability. In part, sustainable consumer behavior was enforced (e.g. less travel), in part initiated voluntarily by the population (e.g. aid campaigns such as neighborhood networks), in part promoted by raising awareness (e.g. buying regional products, using resources sparingly). For long-term sustainable development, however, it is essential to maintain as large a part of this shift in behavior as possible even after the Corona crisis. Due to the broad and comprehensive changes in behavior in the entire population, the current time frame in particular offers the opportunity to take a big step towards an awareness and behavior characterized by sustainability. An essential aspect of achieving this goal is answering the question of how consumers can be supported in overcoming the attitude-behaviour gaps that are likely to arise after the Corona crisis. Evidence shows that many consumers are fundamentally willing to behave more sustainably. At the same time, however, there are barriers to realizing this change (Stengel 2011) and there is a risk that many of the positive changes that can currently be observed will disappear again after the return to normal everyday life."," Grebmer Carmen,  Georgi Dominik,  Dahinden Larissa,  Oswald Laura,  Attinger Meriel,  Boenigk Michael,  Bründler Susanne"," Zbinden Marcel,  Georgi Dominik"

With the development of gender research in regional development, the foundations are to be created in order to implement these aspects in Swiss regional development in a forward-looking manner. Research results and practical experiences from EU countries served as best practice examples for Switzerland. The basis for achieving the project goals was formed by an in-depth literature analysis as well as extensive research and analyzes of trend-setting projects in gender-oriented regional politics. In an empirical part, interviews were conducted with specialists from regional management, from science and from administration. The evaluation of the interviews was related to the results of the literature analysis and the research of practical examples.

The question of how what knowledge circulates under this condition and is considered legitimate suggested a discourse-analytical approach. While the educational expansion in Germany around 1970 was accompanied by a more scientific approach to music pedagogy, the further development of school music in German-speaking Switzerland remained a matter for practitioners who did not present any finalized concepts, but were regularly mentioned in relevant journals. The aim of the project was to systematize such written statements in order to create the basis for a theory of the German-Swiss form of school music. For this purpose, a corpus of around 1600 documents dealing with (music) pedagogical questions and containing statements on the content and legitimacy of the subject as well as on the professional understanding of the teachers responsible for it were analyzed with a lens sharpened to Foucault's discourse theory. Key texts were used to work out central patterns of interpretation that determined the school music discourse between 1970 and 2010. The central finding of the project is that the front position runs along the axis practice – scientificity during the entire period of investigation and determines the discourse, whereby the primacy of practice is set as inevitable and strategically enforced. Pragmatic thinking and action is emphasized in the discourse as a specifically Swiss quality and strength and is held up against overly theoretical (German) approaches, which is also expressed in the demand for language that is understandable for practitioners. This finding is significant for the educational policy decision to academize all teacher training. Because without the development of a differentiated understanding of the profession, which combines the special qualities of practical knowledge with research-based approaches, there will continue to be friction losses and resistance. It was also shown that in the early 21st century the substantive discourse largely fell silent in favor of a political direction and that traditional patterns of interpretation such as transfer effects were used. This discourse, which emphasizes reproductive musical practice, is nourished by the fear that the existing university system cannot maintain a subject for compulsory school. The results of the project offer a variety of connection options for the didactic training of music professionals. In addition, the systematic basis for further research in the field was developed, which in turn should flow back into practice. A corresponding project, which combines interview studies with lesson analyses, is under review at the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)."," Marty Christoph,  Camp Marc-Antoine,  Käser Margret", Huber Jürg

Around 80 children have the opportunity to learn a wind instrument in a class, to make music together, to develop a lasting enjoyment of music and to show their environment the importance of musical education. All participating students are introduced to playing an instrument, regardless of their parental home or cultural background. At least some of them should be motivated to take instrumental lessons at a music school and perhaps be able to discover talents that they do not yet have. The primary school teachers involved can build up or expand their musical skills with regard to teaching wind instruments.

The aim of the research project was to examine the various factors that led to great dynamism in the three Swiss cities of Aarau, Geneva and Lucerne in the 1970s. At these three locations, artists experimented with new artistic content and media, and lively local art scenes, artist groups and community studios developed, such as the Ziegelrain in Aarau. Institutions such as the Kunstmuseum Luzern and non-institutional venues such as the Center d'Art Contemporain in Geneva organized exhibitions that attracted national and international audiences. A pointed art criticism, publications and editions contributed to increased national and international awareness. In all three cities, a new artistic self-image emerged, an awareness of being close to the pulse of the times and the international art scene. In addition to literature and archive research, oral history was a central method of the project. The aim was to investigate the circumstances under which a special dynamic and concentration arises in a city. The key questions of the research project were: In which art historical, historical, political and local environment does a specific dynamic and peculiarity develop? What role do certain actors such as artists, curators, training institutes play? What is the relationship between these institutional spaces and the art scene and the art market? How similar or how do the perceptions and assessments of different participants differ, and how do assessments of the past differ from those of today? Are the developments at the three selected locations comparable? Around 40 interviews were conducted with artists, curators, gallery owners, art critics, art historians and politicians. The interviews moved in the field of tension between a present-day perspective on the events of that time and a joint exploration of “how it was back then”. The comparison between then and now was also the subject of two workshops and panels in Lucerne and Geneva. Within this framework, the results and open questions from the interviews were discussed with individual interviewees and other experts from the cultural sector in the sense of a critical oral history.

The aim of the project is to provide a ""development environment"" that allows the process of auralization to influence the design of office spaces in a targeted manner. In addition, the simulation of the room acoustics should allow an evaluation of the acoustic quality (according to current standards, measurement methods and target values) of a room that is currently being planned. The COMSOL program can calculate the sound field of any room for different frequencies using the finite element method (FEM). The calculated spectrum of a location in space is an abstract quantity (see figure). It is impossible to draw conclusions about the acoustic room quality based on this spectrum. The human ear works much more subtly and perceives the finest differences. Therefore, the acoustic quality of a room must be reproduced as a listening experience. The calculations are made audible by combining the spectra with an audio generator (Matlab) and Franz Zimmermann's acoustic simulator. We focus on medium and small rooms such as classrooms, offices or seminar rooms. Since FEM solves the wave equations, complex geometries or interfering objects are also correctly taken into account. This is the real advantage over products that use sound propagation times to simulate large concert halls. The FEM approach is computationally intensive but accurate and is therefore ideally suited for speech reproduction in small rooms."," Notter Gregor,  Csikos György,  Wassner Jürgen,  Schälli Othmar,  Hüsler René,  Graf Thomas", Stössel Zeno

The aim of the project was to develop management principles aimed at increasing the customer orientation of employees. After all, customer orientation is considered a key factor in corporate success. These leadership principles should be supported both theoretically and empirically. In a first phase of the project, a detailed study of the literature was carried out. Based on this study of the literature, a first publication was prepared, which explained these theoretical considerations in more detail. This well-founded research should be printed in a scientific journal. The core aspect of this contribution was that customer orientation does not only depend on the employees, but that customer orientation must be an issue at all management levels of a company: starting with the owner, through the board to the operational management. These three levels can be thought of as cogs that mesh, turning in one direction and setting the pace at which the company's customer engine runs. It was also shown that successful companies, in addition to a high degree of customer orientation, also have a moderate sales orientation. Consequently, it is not important for companies to maximize customer orientation, but to optimize customer and sales orientation. This article was finally published in mid-2011. The article also won the publication prize of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Subsequently, it was necessary to determine specific management tools that serve to increase customer orientation and sales orientation. This information allows managers to control and optimize both forms. Based on an existing data set, which was collected in the banking sector, clear instruments could ultimately be identified that can serve to increase customer orientation or sales orientation. The data analysis was carried out using statistical-mathematical methods."," Hanisch Christoph,  Hottiger Dieter,  Willimann Ivo,  Schwarz Jürg,  Bieri Marcel,  Hafner Nils,  Kaudela-Baum Stephanie,  Durrer Tamara", Sprenger Martin

For this purpose, the interdisciplinary project team orients itself on the one hand to social space-related living conditions and on the other hand takes into account (inter)national examples of good practice from the field of social planning. This approach is also supplemented by the concept of the living environment. Such an approach focuses on the perspective of the social space and individual backgrounds of experience. Furthermore, as part of the conceptual work, there is a discussion of the extent to which mapping can be used as an effective instrument for conveying information. In this context, it is important to show (new) possibilities of how the recorded living conditions can be meaningfully represented in spatial structures. The findings from the initial project serve as the basis for a follow-up project, which aims to develop a practical tool for social and spatial planning."," Da Rui Gena,  Steiner Thomas,  Zwimpfer Victor", Stremlow Jürgen

In addition, individualization and thus production with batch sizes1 are becoming increasingly important because this means that every customer can be offered a valuable one-off. For the textile industry, this means that they are both prepared for a wide variety of materials and textile techniques and can also flexibly adapt them in the production process .Saurer is one of the largest textile machine manufacturers in the world, developing innovations for the world here in Switzerland. You would like to start developing a smart factory with an application machine. The application machine is to digitally control and carry out different processes in the second as well as in the third dimension on textiles with interchangeable attachments. Here, the internal mechanical engineering, paired with the digitization and strengthening of the textile know-how and its applicability, is innovatively brought forward. At the same time, the company would like to be able to move flexibly and closer to the rapidly changing trends in the fashion, home textiles, medtech and sports industries. An important element is the integration of these machines in a digital process in order to match production with customer requirements directly and promptly to be able to connect. For example, order portals could be linked to a user interface to make it easier for users to describe their textile wishes and to have them manufactured on demand quickly, easily and inexpensively, even in small quantities. In this way, Saurer itself, or corresponding service providers, could produce orders in-house and deliver them directly. However, it would have to be checked in advance whether a POS (Point of Sales) or a POD (Point of Design) concept is used for such a link. Saurer is well positioned for the development of such a smart factory, as it is of three-dimensional processing methods in textiles is technically at the forefront on the world market and therefore there are already a wide range of design options in textiles. Due to the desired, high degree of automation of the application machine, production in the high-wage country of Switzerland is also attractive, which on the one hand allows an additional branch of the economy to be considered and on the other hand the proximity to current trends and demands remains.

Efficient, targeted innovation management is therefore more important than ever to ensure the long-term competitiveness of companies. In order to achieve positive employment effects, the competence to develop new services quickly and efficiently must be further expanded. Although Switzerland has a leading position in terms of innovation performance in the service sector in a European comparison, it has lost its lead over other innovative economies considerably in the last ten years (Spyros 2004, p. 9).

Experts from 14 international countries contributed their know-how in the three subject areas ""Criteria for Architectural Integration"", ""Methods and Tools"" and ""Concepts, Case Studies and Guidelines"". In all three subject areas, the increased implementation of solar-designed buildings with high architectural quality was the focus of the question. The research project has shown that better qualifications for planners and architects, improved communication between planners and architects, builders, engineers and manufacturers of solar products and systems, increased sensitivity on the part of manufacturers of solar products and systems with regard to building integration issues and suitable Tools for the solar design of buildings and settlements are indispensable if more attractive solar buildings and settlements are to be realized.

The aim of the project is to identify practice-relevant levers that enable effective and preventive compliance in Swiss companies. ""Compliance"" is now considered a basic requirement for the ""license to operate"" and is therefore a critical management function for organizations with a high level of resource commitment. Numerous corporate scandals related to compliance violations suggest that companies are not always able to adequately manage company-wide compliance risk. One of the reasons for this is that there is currently no established method for quantifying the effectiveness of compliance. This results in a legitimation problem for the responsible managers, since the (high) compliance expenses are difficult to justify (Chen and Soltes 2018). The present project addresses this challenge: The aim of the research project is to measure the effectiveness and value contribution of compliance in medium-sized and large Swiss companies. The starting point for the research project is a compliance model based on scientific literature. This theoretical model is tested in practice together with the implementation partners, further developed and then validated throughout Switzerland as part of a quantitative analysis. The development of this compliance model addresses the connections between factors of effective compliance and the impact on corporate success, whereby a ""paradigm shift in dealing with compliance"" is aimed at. It is important to identify possible levers that have a positive impact on the cost-benefit ratio of compliance measures. These levers will effectively and sustainably improve the compliance of Swiss companies. Furthermore, companies should be able to quantify the value contribution of compliance, so that compliance is not only understood as a cost factor, but as added value (e.g. to increase competitiveness)."," Renda Aline,  Unruh Anjuli,  Bauhofer Marc,  Lustenberger Noé,  Váradi Nóra Irén,  Stupar Sandra,  Hunziker Stefan,  Laun Ute"," Durrer Mirjam,  Hunziker Stefan"

""D'Musikante chömid"" can also stand as a metaphor for the extremely lively and rich folk music traditions of the canton of Obwalden, the stories of which, however, have only been historically worked through selectively. This applies in particular to the brass bands that have existed since the 19th century - mostly called 5 to 11er Muisig - and the brass bands, folk and yodelling songs, Ländler bands and amateur theater that are closely associated with them.

""Solar buildings"" are to be understood in their organisational, structural and formal language as an expression of an energy concept. When consistently applied, this climate rhetoric leads to new typologies of climate-friendly buildings and requires new, integrative and holistic design strategies. Active and passive solar strategies are not consistently integrated into the architecture and the building these days. This means that active solar products are mostly understood as additive and purely technical, or the consistent inclusion of an optimal use of daylight is missing. With an approach geared towards planners and architects as well as the building, methods for the increased inclusion of solar strategies in architecture were developed in this project. The examination of an apartment building in the city of Lucerne from the 1950s has shown that both passive-solar and active-solar strategies can be used effectively to cover the required operating energy during renovation. The earlier this happens in the planning, the better the solar potential can be exploited. However, planners and architects often lack the appropriate tools for a rough quantitative assessment of the early planning decisions as well as for project evaluation in the detailed planning. Also, the early planning phases and post-commissioning operational optimization are rarely included in the design process, despite their great importance. In order for the potential of the sun to be fully exploited, the solar content must be communicated in an understandable way and incorporated into the current architectural language. For this, new, more colorful, more transparent and more playful products as well as simplified possibilities for architectural integration must increasingly attract the interest of planners and architects. The latter are responsible for the fact that the new materials are used as creative and energetically effective elements on roofs and facades as well as in windows and other components. This is the only way to bring about a new generation of sustainable buildings. Due to the simultaneous participation in the IEA SHC Task 41 ""Solar Energy and Architecture"", this project was closely networked with the international environment."," Mayer Amelie-Theres,  Schuchert Christian Lars,  Gerber Dorothe,  Koller Fabienne,  Zweifel Gerhard,  Schumacher Jörg,  Bürgin Matthias,  Plagaro Cowee Natalie,  Heim Thomas,  Sturm Ulrike"," Ehrbar Doris,  Moosberger Sven"

Over 98% of the approximately 312,000 Swiss companies are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - and almost 90% of these SMEs are family-owned. The reciprocal connection between family and company means that family-run companies differ significantly from public companies in some areas, for example corporate strategy or investment behavior. This means that family businesses often need solutions to specific challenges. This need has been recognized both in theory and in practice. Numerous private and institutional providers offer specialized services for family businesses. Nevertheless, it is surprising that no university of applied sciences has dealt in depth with this extremely practice-oriented field of research, which also offers a wide range of opportunities for training and further education. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts therefore aims to develop and disseminate knowledge and skills in the field of family businesses.

Overview We thank the following institutions for financial support of various aspects of the project: The Arnold Bentley New Initiatives Fund will be used (co-funding) to animate the dissemination of research results through two musical concerts. Their program is based on recent studies of the everyday music use of people with Parkinson's disease in the UK. The concerts are in collaboration with the Royal Northern College of Music. Consultation The consultation study (co-funded by Parkinson Switzerland) will include a mixed methods study on the use of music by people with Parkinson's disease in Switzerland (German, Italian and French speaking) and will explore how they want to use music to improve their quality of life. The insights will be deepened through several workshops in order to develop context-appropriate materials for the music-based intervention protocol. A new online resource, 'Playlist for Parkinson's', is being developed as a public platform. In addition, best practice materials for healthcare professionals and for future research will be developed. Development and testing An international randomized control study (RCT; co-financed by the SNSF) will examine the cross-cultural application and examine the generalizability of the use of music to improve the quality of life of people affected by Parkinson's disease. A new measurement protocol with motion detection and pressure-sensitive gait mat is to be developed in order to quantitatively support clinical and standardized measurements. The results will then be summarized in an intervention protocol that will be tested in Lucerne, Lugano and London. Throughout the process, PD sufferers and professionals are consulted, bringing their expertise to develop the best possible multimodal music-based intervention to improve neurorehabilitation in PD care. This project lays the groundwork for the development of a low-cost, low-resource, group intervention whose delivery can be adapted for common spaces (e.g., church spaces) and increases accessibility by, for example, reducing costs and allowing for the involvement of family and friends. This will increase awareness of Parkinson's and reduce the personal, social and, for many, isolating stigmas associated with the disease. Such a collaborative approach, using music and movement for social connectedness, is said to be part of music's evolutionary legacy. The integrative development process, mutual learning and multidisciplinary knowledge sharing that characterize the project will encourage transdisciplinary dialogue and provide a model for healthcare organizations and policymakers to consider the effects of music in PD care and create a legacy beyond the project ."," Baldassarre Antonio,  Sigrist Carlo,  Alessandri Elena,  Ungerer Marietta,  Senn Olivier,  Köchli Sabrina,  Halter Valérie"," Rose Dawn Carole,  Rose Dawn"

For the first time, the study provides an overview of these crimes in (German-)Switzerland. Against this background, possible preventive measures are discussed. The overarching aim of the study was to analyze the number of cases and the phenomenology of the crime of killing newborns (neonicide) in German-speaking Switzerland and the image that relevant professional groups and the population have of this crime. For this purpose, on the one hand - where available - criminal case files on cases of the killing of newborns from twelve German-speaking cantons (1980-2010); on the other hand, as part of a questionnaire study, a multi-layer random sample of a total of 374 people from six German-speaking Swiss cantons was asked about their level of knowledge about the phenomenon of negated pregnancy and neonaticide, 151 of them were specialists (social workers, gynaecologists, paediatricians ], general practitioners). The study confirms that neonaticides are also relatively rare in (German) Switzerland compared to other homicides. On average, one case per year is reported throughout Switzerland. However, it remains unclear how many cases remain hidden. In the case of neonaticide in particular, a high number of unreported cases is assumed, partly because it is often a consequence of failed pregnancies. To a large extent, the results confirm the findings of studies from other countries on neonaticides; However, some of the German-speaking Swiss cases analyzed also have special characteristics. The so-called baby hatches and ""anonymous birth"" are discussed as possible ways of preventing neonaticides, both in specialist literature and in the media; the vast majority of respondents also considered this to be a suitable preventive measure. However, their usefulness in these cases seems doubtful, especially against the background of the pregnancies usually denied by the children's mothers. This is all the more true as the women's relatives and friends are often satisfied with excuses and often extremely implausible explanations. Sensitized to certain signs, however, it is precisely the women's wider and closer environment that may intervene in good time, prevent the pregnancy from becoming public and thus prevent the newborn from being killed. The same applies to certain professional groups, such as B. Social workers or doctors. The results of the questionnaire study show that there is still a need for clarification. The false belief that the majority of the crimes are committed by mentally ill, especially young and/or foreign women, appears to be particularly problematic.",, Krüger Paula
